# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `get_script_data` as the read-only v3 path for Bridge-owned SynthV
  plugin data, while keeping `script_data` limited to guarded writes.
- Added `record_ai_usage`, which stores an explicit versioned AI-usage
  disclosure on a fingerprint-guarded Track through SynthV's persistent Script
  Data API.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Documented `fingerprint` guards as Context-filled instead of hand-copied.
  Guarded note, Smart Pitch, and Retake fields are now optional in the action
  schemas the Agent reads, and a write without both a `contextId` and an
  explicit guard fails in TypeScript instead of reaching the host (issue #8.1).
- `sv_query.fields` now documents that it filters only top-level keys of the
  result root, and a projection that matches no root key returns a
  `projectionWarning` with the available keys instead of a silent empty
  object (issue #8.2).
- Described the `sv_describe.action` parameter that returns one just-in-time
  action schema (issue #8.3).
- Corrected the `edit_notes` and `delete_notes` action-schema guidance so one
  fresh write-intent Context can serve disjoint batches instead of directing
  Agents to refresh it unconditionally between batches.

### Changed

- `get_track_notes` compacts and densifies its nested `groups[].notes` on the
  `sv_query` projection path, dropping blick/quarter duplicates of positions
  already carried in group-local and seconds units (issue #8.4).
- Raised the default response timeout to 30 s and the stale-recovery age to
  60 s so a cold SynthV host can answer its first request (issue #8.5).
- A client now waits up to `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_LOCK_WAIT_MS` (1 s by default)
  for the single-writer IPC lock before reporting `BRIDGE_BUSY` (issue #8.8).
- Documented the recommended batch write path: at most about 60 note edits per
  call, and one `writeIntent` `contextId` reused across disjoint batches, with a
  fresh read only after a note changes or an add/delete shifts indices
  (issues #8.6 and #8.7).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-03

- Separated the host-neutral MCP Runtime from Agent skills and demo assets.
- Added equal project-scoped connection profiles for Codex and Claude Code.
- Made Doctor core-only by default with explicit host-profile checks.
- Kept file IPC protocol v3 and the six public `sv_*` tools unchanged.

## 0.2.0-alpha.1 - 2026-07-30

### Breaking

- Replaced the eight-tool MCP v2 surface with the six-tool v3 semantic Facade:
  `sv_status`, `sv_describe`, `sv_query`, `sv_command`, `sv_ui`, and
  `sv_review`.
- Replaced file IPC protocol v2 with v3. There is no runtime compatibility
  mode; Node, Lua, and the optional Sidebar must be upgraded as one build set.

### Added

- Typed `readOnly` and `writeIntent` Query Contexts.
- Public Command outcomes `changed`, `alreadySatisfied`, and `failed`.
- Redacted cross-layer traces, byte/timing measurements, and component Build
  Identity with project-write coherence gating.
- Strict numeric Lua command-stage telemetry and explicit bounded
  `sv_status(operation="diagnostics")` support/debug projections; ordinary
  status and command results do not include Trace history.
- A bounded read Snapshot cache foundation that is not used for write
  authorization and remains measurement-gated.
- Fault-injectable Lua behavior tests for clone isolation, shared ownership,
  stale Guards, no-op Undo behavior, Automation endpoints, aggregate Undo,
  session invalidation, postcondition failures, and partial-write recovery.
- Closed-range Automation postcondition verification and compact stale
  fingerprint summaries.

### Changed

- All live semantic writes are classified by the v3 Command Policy catalog and
  enter the common Command Dispatcher. High-risk note, clone, aggregate
  tuning, Automation, Smart Pitch, and dependent-transaction paths add
  action-specific fresh preflight and postcondition verification.
- A focused `get_track_mixer` write-intent read now carries a private Track
  guard into a directly reusable `contextId`, avoiding a detour through
  `list_tracks`.
- The installer stages and verifies one component set and restores the prior
  set if replacement fails.
- Local source builds record the current Git commit at build time when no CI
  build metadata is supplied; the running Bridge remains Git- and network-free.
- Build metadata is generated explicitly by build, development, and typecheck
  commands, so clean checkouts do not depend on npm lifecycle hooks or commit a
  self-referential generated Git revision.
- Hot reload now accepts the installer’s current schema-v2 manifest, including
  hosts that cannot recover the running script path from Lua debug metadata.
- Sidebar refresh failures now report the failing stage, keep the polling loop
  alive, and retry WidgetValue updates instead of poisoning the displayed-value
  cache after a transient host error.

### Fixed

- Sidebar shutdown is now awaitable and drains its tracked status/poll work
  before publishing the final stopped state. Server shutdown reuses one close
  Promise and still finishes Sidebar cleanup if transport close fails,
  preventing late writes from racing shutdown and temporary-directory cleanup.

### Known alpha limits

- The bounded Snapshot cache is intentionally not active; every project Query
  reaches SynthV because current measurements do not justify stale-read risk.
- Representative SynthV 2.2.1 standalone working-copy acceptance is recorded,
  but stable `0.2.0` still requires the release gates outside the Phase 4-6
  implementation plan.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-31

This release promotes the verified 31-write v3 surface to a reduced-stable
baseline. Seven native-risk clone/transaction/harmony paths remain
experimental and fail before project IPC. The one-hour functional Stage 3
soak passed; the user explicitly waived the post-fix resource-monitor rerun,
which remains a documented follow-up risk and is not claimed as a pass.

### Added

- An executable `validate:v3-reads` release driver that generates the exact
  1,000-call/17-Query Stage 3 schedule, verifies project/Session/executor
  identity around every call, enforces the 20 KB public budget, emits only
  aggregate evidence, and refuses a full live matrix before explicit Stage 2
  completion.
- An executable `validate:v3-stability` driver for concurrent requests,
  Bridge reload/Session invalidation, reduced-capability fail-closed repetition,
  and real-host trace on/off p95 comparison, plus the default-on
  `SYNTHV_AGENT_TRACE_ENABLED` validation switch.
- A machine-checked 200-call Stage 3 write schedule over all 31 verified write
  Actions, with six or seven cycles per Action, plus an explicit separate
  30-cycle linked-clone/Undo requirement.
- A complete v3 Query policy registry covering all 17 read Actions, a shared
  model-facing projector, a 20,000-character unscoped default-response gate,
  and bounded projection telemetry. The first shadow slices for
  `get_track_mixer`, `get_group_voice`, `list_tracks`, and
  `list_note_groups` compare independently built projections from the same
  host result, record only bounded parity/item counts, preserve nested
  Contexts and ownership summaries, and keep all private Guards server-side.
- Default host pages for time-axis marks, Tracks, library Groups, notes,
  computed note data, and Smart Pitch controls. Compact Automation reads now
  omit point arrays unless an explicit closed range is requested, while their
  full private OCC fingerprint remains available for Context creation.
- Retry-safe computed-data pages that preserve pending state without advancing,
  direct Smart Pitch page serialization, and independent Group/note paging for
  `get_track_notes`.
- Node-local `inspect_score_file` and `import_monophonic_score` actions for
  explicitly supplied local MusicXML (`.xml`, `.musicxml`, `.mxl`) and SMF MIDI
  (`.mid`, `.midi`) files. Inspection returns selectable lanes, overlap
  diagnostics, a bounded preview, source tempo, and a SHA-256 guard without
  editing SynthV. Import requires `rightsConfirmed: true`, rejects changed
  files, ambiguity/polyphony, unsafe XML, URLs, `.svp`, and more than 512 notes,
  then uses the ordinary guarded `add_notes` path without applying source tempo.
- `clone_track_shell`, which uses a host track clone to carry the source main
  Vocal context into one verified-empty track while removing non-main Groups,
  notes, Smart Pitch controls, known automation, and—by default—mixer state.
  The result explicitly reports that the official API cannot read or name the
  inherited Vocal identity.
- Forward transaction `$result` references to earlier 1-based step results.
  Independent steps retain full preflight; result-dependent steps are resolved
  and validated just in time inside one native undo boundary.
- A bundled, machine-readable Mandarin Twinkle Star guided Demo. The Agent
  offers it once after the first healthy connection, prints five concise stage
  headings, creates only an isolated 42-note non-main Group, pauses for the
  required Vocal/Vocal Mode handoff, then uses the internal actions to tune,
  verify, and loop the song without changing user-owned project material.
- A one-time MCP first-use notice that tells the Agent to ask for the current
  singer's exact Vocal Mode names or a panel screenshot before Vocal Mode work,
  reuse the result for that singer, and ask again only after a singer change.
- v3 `add_notes` defaults to `grouping=ensureNonMain`. Notes aimed at a
  track main group are inserted into a newly created reusable non-main group
  and reference, with the main Voice/Vocal Modes copied so the new notes remain
  directly tunable. Explicit non-main groups are reused, and
  `grouping=target` preserves exact-target insertion.
- A compact `get_phrase_context` read that resolves the current piano-roll
  Group or an explicit note/time scope and returns write-ready note and
  automation Guard Tokens, Group voice/Vocal Modes, bounded rhythm/pitch
  diagnostics, and recommendation-only review targets in one IPC round trip.
- Optional computed-pitch summaries that retain only aggregate contour metrics
  instead of returning every sampled frame.
- Explicit `overlap` versus binary-seek `onset` range coverage with diagnostics
  that disclose when earlier crossing sustains may be omitted.
- Opaque, fingerprint-guarded phrase page cursors that continue without
  rescanning skipped pages and fail closed when their boundary note changes.
- Up to 32 phrase ranges in one request, using one Group sweep, one shared
  unique-note serialization, per-range diagnostics, and automation curves
  fingerprinted only once.

### Changed

- Isolated Group-reference clone, Note Group/Track/Track-shell clone, harmony
  Track, and transaction apply/rollback are classified experimental and fail
  before project IPC after reproducible SynthV 2.2.1 native crashes. Linked
  Group-reference clone remains available.
- The machine-readable API coverage inventory uses `verifiedUi` and accepts
  the release terminal states `verified`, `unsupported`, and `experimental`;
  its checker rejects drift from the live capability-stability registry.
- Note Group content writes now reject multiply referenced Groups by default.
  An intentional all-reference edit must set
  `sharedGroupPolicy=allowAllReferences` and provide a matching fresh
  `expectedReferenceCount`; reference-local fields remain independently
  editable.
- `clone_track` now rejects sources with non-main vocal Groups unless
  `nonMainGroupPolicy=detach` is explicit. Detach verifies independent Group
  content but does not claim that the unreadable non-main Vocal identities were
  preserved; callers must review those Vocals manually.
- MCP v3 Contexts are target-typed and source-scope-bound. Locator-only reads
  no longer mint write-capable Contexts, and incompatible actions or conflicting
  explicit locators/guards fail closed instead of silently changing scope.
- Transaction results describe `atomicity: "singleUndoRecord"` as a recovery
  boundary, not automatic rollback. A dependent validation or host execution
  failure reports the failed step, partial-write possibility, and whether the
  user must invoke SynthV Undo once before retrying.
- Selection, viewport, and playback controls return the state observed from
  SynthV after the request instead of only echoing requested values.
- MCP v3 promotes `get_phrase_context` projections supplied only through
  `args.include` into the canonical top-level `sv_query.include` selection
  before Guard capture. Supplying different projections in both locations
  fails early with a protocol error instead of silently dropping Automation or
  pitch-analysis Context data.
- File IPC accepts only the compact protocol-v3 request/response envelope;
  Lua rejects protocol-v1/v2 requests with `PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`. The public MCP
  server exposes only the six compact v3 tools, and detailed action handlers
  cannot be registered as standalone tools. `sv_describe` returns their schemas
  just in time.
- The installer manifest now uses the independent `schemaVersion` field instead
  of overloading `protocolVersion`.
- MCP-requested Bridge reloads now wait for the changed heartbeat session token
  and clear Context/Guard caches before `sv_status` returns.
- `get_group_voice` can resolve the current piano-roll Group from an empty
  payload. MCP v3 projects only target indices, documented parameters,
  Vocal Modes, and `contextId` by default, avoiding a full selection read and
  duplicate raw/diagnostic fields when only refreshing a Voice write guard.
- First-use instructions distinguish relevant manual edits from unrelated UI
  work and require only a compact target reread after undo or overlapping
  manual edits.
- The native side panel is explicitly optional, starts in a compact layout,
  surfaces pending confirmations automatically, and can be omitted at install
  time with `--without-sidebar`. Core Bridge/MCP operation remains complete.
- Side-panel scope is limited to stability and interaction maintenance rather
  than performance work or duplicating SynthV editing controls.
- Phrase context automatically prefers selected notes, includes the pitch and
  timing fields needed for tuning, caps notes/recommendations/automation
  parameters, and never uses a cross-request cache that could become stale
  after an editor change.
- Phrase notes round seconds to 0.1 ms and omit repeated default-valued phoneme,
  detune, and selection fields while retaining every non-default override.
- The default overlap behavior remains unchanged. Faster onset-only seeking and
  multi-range reads are explicit opt-ins.

### Fixed

- Default and explicit Track-note projections remove nested main Group UUIDs;
  command/UI acknowledgements and errors no longer expose private UUID or Guard
  data.
- Doctor compares installed executor/Sidebar files after the same Build ID
  injection used by the installer, eliminating false mismatches.
- Windows Sidebar status replacement retries bounded `EBUSY`, `EACCES`, and
  `EPERM` races and records the writer PID.
- Track, Group, time-axis, and metadata no-ops return `alreadySatisfied`
  without opening Undo; collection mutations now verify count, identity, and
  survivor order after host writes.
- Guardless Group reads and Track collection pages now remove private Group
  UUIDs even when no write-capable Context is minted.
- Retake note fingerprints and nested Track fingerprints from Track-note reads
  are now consumed into server-side Contexts or discarded before projection
  instead of crossing the public MCP boundary.
- `get_track_notes` Context projection now retains its track locator for nested
  Group Contexts, while Context expansion rejects kind/scope mismatches and
  conflicting guarded-array fingerprints.
- Empty `vocalModeParams` maps are no longer mistaken for an unsupported
  singer. `set_group_voice` can initialize multiple previously omitted modes
  in one request, clone-probes the complete batch, retains all requested values,
  and still rejects genuinely unsupported names before creating an undo
  record. Agents no longer need per-mode discovery interactions. A genuine
  name failure now returns structured instructions to stop guessing and ask
  the user for the exact Vocal Mode names displayed for the current singer.
- The installer now distinguishes a successful in-session hot reload from
  SynthV's cached menu-script source. When the Bridge runtime changed, it asks
  for one script rescan before the next project/app restart and manual launch,
  preventing a cached older handler from reclaiming the session.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Optional `compact` responses for phoneme and automation tuning workflows,
  including note-index/absolute-seconds filters and compact write
  acknowledgements.
- MCP-local short Guard Tokens that replace verbose note and automation
  fingerprints in compact responses while preserving protocol-v1 stale-write
  validation inside SynthV.
- Clone-first and project-write postcondition checks for phoneme properties,
  plus a read-only Group voice capability probe for phoneme-strength retention.
- Response-size regression coverage that keeps a representative 21-note compact
  tuning context below 4 KB.
- Projection diagnostics and an `includeComputedPhonemes` switch for
  guard/override refreshes that do not require whole-Group host computation.

### Changed

- MCP text results now use minified JSON to reduce transport and model-context
  overhead. Full response mode remains the backward-compatible default.
- Guard Tokens are resolved consistently for direct writes, transaction steps,
  and sidebar previews; compact transaction results return replacement tokens.
- Exact-index and ordinary paginated phoneme reads fetch only the returned page;
  time filters convert their boundaries once and stop after the range, and note
  attributes are snapshotted once per returned note.
- Default response polling is reduced from 50 ms to 10 ms, with the Lua request
  loop reduced from 100 ms to 25 ms while retaining one-second heartbeats and
  bounded session ownership checks.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-07-26

### Added

- A native SynthV 2.1.2+ `SidePanelSection` with Bridge/MCP status,
  current-selection summaries, an instruction queue, guarded change previews,
  Apply/Dismiss controls, and latest-operation/undo guidance.
- `sidebar_get_request` and `sidebar_publish_preview` MCP tools plus a
  network-free TypeScript coordinator that executes confirmed previews through
  the existing serialized file IPC client.
- Typed Group voice reads/writes for documented base parameters and per-axis
  Vocal Mode settings, guarded by Group-reference fingerprints and clone-first
  host validation. Vocal Mode axes accept non-negative finite values rather
  than imposing a stale fixed ceiling. Sparse preflight detects when SynthV
  would clamp unrequested legacy values such as 180 or 220; both those unsafe
  partial updates and directly clamped values are rejected before an undo
  record is created.
- Experimental Unison `singers` and `spacing` access that is enabled only when
  the current SynthV host returns and retains those fields.
- Dedicated phoneme reads and fingerprint-verified writes for language and
  phoneset overrides, syllable timing, and per-phoneme timing/strength
  attributes.
- In-session Bridge hot reload through `reload_bridge` and the installer. Once
  this version has been started manually, later installs can reload the Lua
  executor without mouse automation, hooks, or another manual script launch.
- Group voice and phoneme reads now report current/selected editor context.
  Their write tools offer opt-in guards for the current piano-roll Group and
  selected notes while retaining explicit unselected-object automation.
- Side-panel diagnostics, explicit task states, structured before/after/risk
  previews, cancellation, and a clearable 20-entry privacy-limited history.
- `sidebar_status` plus a read-only `npm run doctor` command for versions,
  Bridge/MCP heartbeats, IPC state, installed scripts, and Codex configuration.
- Full-preflight `apply_transaction` batches of up to 32 independent writes in
  one undo record, with optional guarded reverse steps for current-session
  `rollback_transaction`.
- Range-constrained harmony-track creation, deterministic fingerprint-guarded
  timing humanization, lyrics-to-note fitting, and scoop, falloff, vibrato,
  crescendo, and breathiness expression presets.

### Fixed

- Keep both Bridge and MCP heartbeat indicators visible in the narrow native
  side panel, and clarify that project Undo requires main-editor focus or
  **Edit > Undo** when a side-panel text field has focus.
- Detect whether the installed side-panel file actually changed, avoid
  unnecessary rescans, and explain that a required SynthV rescan stops the
  persistent Bridge and must be followed by one manual Bridge start.
- Keep the real SynthV 2.2.1 `Project` object during transaction preflight and
  intercept only the shared undo-record boundary, avoiding invalidated Lua
  object proxies on the live host.

### Security

- Override the MCP SDK's vulnerable transitive `@hono/node-server` dependency
  with `2.0.12`, and fail CI on moderate-or-higher production dependency
  vulnerabilities.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Reusable note-group library creation, cloning, listing, deletion, and
  linked/deep Group-reference placement.
- Vocal and instrumental Group-reference fingerprints plus safe update/delete
  support.
- Full point/curve Smart Pitch CRUD with per-object fingerprints.
- AI Retake reads plus generation, activation, and deletion for Bridge-tracked
  Take IDs.
- Automation curve sampling and official range simplification.
- Expanded selection reads and writes for Groups, notes, Smart Pitch controls,
  and automation points.
- Main-editor and arrangement viewport reads/writes, snapping, and coordinate
  conversion.
- Host info, clipboard, dialogs, pitch/frequency conversion, and namespaced
  SynthV object metadata.
- Computed phoneme output alongside computed attributes and pitch samples.

### Changed

- Expanded the additive protocol-v1 action set from 24 to 50 Lua actions and
  the MCP surface from 25 to 51 tools without changing the envelope.
- Raised the minimum SynthV editor version from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 for the official
  Smart Pitch selection API.
- Added SynthV 2.2.1 compatibility handling for Lua object proxies, unavailable
  `pitch2freq`, and the host restriction against selecting main groups.
- Extended the mock SynthV integration harness to cover the new official API
  surface and one-undo-per-write invariant.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Normalize track colors from the public `#RRGGBB` form to the opaque `AARRGGBB` form retained by SynthV, verify color writes, and expose normalized RGB/ARGB read fields.
- Replace occupied tempo and time-signature positions with an explicit remove/add sequence and verify time-axis postconditions so a silent host no-op is never reported as applied.
- Treat `pitchAutoMode` writes as an optional host capability. Requests that already match the current value do not require a setter; unsupported changes now fail before an undo record with `UNSUPPORTED_HOST_CAPABILITY`.

### Changed

- The Lua mock now reproduces the SynthV 2.2.1 behaviors found during live testing, including strict ARGB track colors and occupied time-axis positions that require removal before replacement.
- The Lua integration smoke test is now required to pass in CI.
- Playback smoke coverage now verifies that `pause` reports `stopped` while preserving a non-zero playhead.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Complete tempo/time-signature map reads, tempo-aware position conversion, and fingerprint-guarded time-axis edits.
- Track update, deep clone, and delete tools. Track cloning can preserve the source singer/database while clearing or transposing cloned notes.
- Group reference update and removal tools for names, mute state, offsets, visible range, and voice-expression properties.
- Computed phoneme/rap attribute reads and optional computed-pitch sampling.
- Per-note language override, sing/rap type, pitch-auto mode, rap accent, and retake-count serialization.
- Track and automation fingerprints for optional optimistic-concurrency checks.

### Changed

- `add_track` now returns its main Group locator and UUID in addition to the backward-compatible track summary.
- The mock SynthV integration harness now verifies every new handler, stale-write rejection, advanced note fields, singer-preserving track clone behavior, and exactly one undo record per successful write.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-26

### Added

- MCP stdio server for project, track, note, selection, automation, mixer, and playback operations.
- Persistent SynthV Lua executor with versioned, correlated file IPC.
- Atomic request publication, a single-writer lock, heartbeat, session replacement, and stale-file recovery.
- Group UUID and note-fingerprint optimistic concurrency checks.
- One SynthV undo record per successful write operation.
- Windows/macOS SynthV script installer, tests, CI, protocol documentation, security guidance, and roadmap.
