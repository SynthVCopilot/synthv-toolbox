# SynthV Agent Bridge v3 Release Validation Design

Status: proposed for execution

Date: 2026-07-31

## Goal

Validate `0.2.0-alpha.1` in four increasingly strict stages:

1. prove that the Alpha is safe enough for controlled daily use;
2. close the real-host evidence gaps across the public v3 surface;
3. exercise crash recovery, concurrency, reloads, and sustained operation;
4. make an evidence-based decision to release `0.2.0`, release a reduced
   stable surface, or remain on Alpha.

The validation starts from Git commit `429ac15` on
`codex/v3-implementation`. Historical results are context only. Every release
claim requires fresh evidence from the current source and installed build.

## Supported release scope

The first stable decision covers only:

- Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro;
- Windows 11;
- SynthV standalone mode;
- local file IPC using protocol v3;
- the six public tools `sv_status`, `sv_describe`, `sv_query`, `sv_command`,
  `sv_ui`, and `sv_review`;
- saved disposable project copies for destructive testing.

Plugin and ARA modes are outside this release decision. The Bridge does not
parse or modify `.svp`, identify the current Vocal, enumerate untouched
default Vocal Modes, save projects, or render/export audio.

## Global safety rules

- SynthV is the authoritative project state.
- Every write begins with a fresh `writeIntent` read of the exact target.
- Track, Group, Reference, and note indices remain 1-based at the public
  boundary.
- Shared Group-content writes default to rejection.
- Each logical command creates at most one SynthV Undo record.
- `alreadySatisfied` creates no mutation and no Undo record.
- Any response with `undoRequired=true` stops all reads and writes to that
  target until one SynthV Undo has been performed and the target has been read
  again.
- A timeout, Session change, or native crash invalidates the old Context and
  Guard data. The command is never retried automatically.
- A native crash preserves only the bounded redacted crash breadcrumb. After
  restart, testing resumes from a newly opened saved project copy.
- Tests never infer a Vocal identity. Before the first tuning write, the user
  must select the intended Note Group, assign its Vocal, and provide the
  complete Vocal Mode panel or every exact mode name.
- Test artifacts, logs, and reports must not contain project lyrics, note
  arrays, curves, raw fingerprints, or Vocal identity claims.

## Evidence model

Each scenario records:

- Git commit and Node/Lua/Sidebar build identities;
- SynthV version, operating mode, Session token, and project-copy identity;
- pre-test authoritative projection;
- command outcome, changed count, Undo count, verification state, warnings,
  trace identifier, response bytes, and timings;
- post-test authoritative projection;
- recovery action and authoritative projection after recovery;
- pass, fail, blocked, unsupported, or experimental status.

Automated Fake Host evidence proves deterministic Bridge behavior. Only real
SynthV evidence proves host integration. A scenario is not promoted from
`sampled` to `verified` until its declared real-host repetitions pass.

## Stage 1: Alpha daily-use acceptance

### Purpose

Prove that the installed Alpha supports controlled everyday use on a saved
test project without exposing the unverified tail of the action catalog as
stable.

### Automated gate

Run:

```text
npm run check
node --check scripts/clean.mjs
node --check scripts/install-synthv-bridge.mjs
luac5.4 -p synthv/SynthVAgentBridge.lua synthv/StopSynthVAgentBridge.lua synthv/SynthVAgentSidebar.lua
git diff --check
npm run check:api-coverage
npm run benchmark:v3
```

All commands must exit zero. The current machine must obtain a working Lua 5.4
compiler before this gate can pass; absence of `luac5.4` is `blocked`, not
`passed`.

### Connection and read gate

- Six-tool catalog is present and below 6,000 characters and UTF-8 bytes.
- Protocol v3 is the only accepted envelope.
- Node, Lua, and Sidebar builds match and project writes are allowed.
- Project, time axis, Tracks, library Groups, notes, Voice, phonemes,
  computed data, Pitch Controls, Automation, and Mixer reads return bounded
  public projections.
- Private Group UUIDs, fingerprints, Guards, lyrics, full note arrays, and
  curves do not leak outside explicitly requested bounded projections.
- Session reload invalidates prior Contexts and restores connection.

### Representative write gate

Use one saved disposable project copy and restore every scenario:

- Mixer change, repeated no-op, and one-Undo restoration;
- Sidebar preview, Apply, and one-Undo restoration;
- stale Context and Session-change rejection before Undo;
- shared Group default rejection before Undo;
- linked, isolated, and shell clone semantics with source preservation;
- guarded note edit/delete/transform with phrase geometry preserved;
- Automation point write and closed-range removal with endpoint verification;
- one successful dependent transaction and one dependent-preflight failure
  that explicitly requires one Undo.

The known transaction APPCRASH means transaction support remains experimental
at the Alpha gate even if these representative cases pass.

### Alpha pass criteria

- No native crash during Stage 1.
- No unexpected mutation or extra Undo record.
- Every test-created mutation is restored and the final project projection
  matches its initial projection.
- No Critical or Important defect affects the daily-use scenarios.
- Public responses meet the 20,000-byte Query, 2,048-byte acknowledgement,
  and 4,096-byte error limits.
- Ordinary real-host operations have p95 below 300 ms.

Passing Stage 1 permits the claim: “The Alpha is suitable for controlled daily
use on saved working copies.” It does not permit a stable-release claim.

## Stage 2: Public capability real-host coverage

### Purpose

Replace broad “sampled” and “pending” labels with explicit real-host evidence
or remove unsupported capabilities from the stable surface.

### Query and UI coverage

- Exercise all 17 Query actions with default and boundary projections.
- Exercise all 9 UI actions and verify the actual selection, viewport,
  clipboard/dialog, snapping/coordinates, playback state, and playhead
  returned by SynthV.
- Verify 1-based indices, paging reconstruction, pending computed data, and
  response budgets on small and large synthetic targets.

### Write coverage

Exercise all 38 public write actions. Each action must finish in exactly one
of these states:

- `verified`: successful write, no-op where applicable, preflight rejection,
  postcondition read, and Undo recovery passed on real SynthV;
- `unsupported`: the host capability is absent and the Bridge fails closed
  before Undo with an accurate public error;
- `experimental`: retained outside the stable surface with an explicit user
  warning and release note.

Coverage includes:

- time-axis, Track, Group, Reference, Mixer, and metadata writes;
- note add/edit/delete/transform, lyrics, phoneme properties, humanization,
  expression, and score import;
- Retake generate/activate/delete where the installed host exposes the
  capability;
- Smart Pitch add/edit/delete;
- Automation set/simplify/closed-range clear;
- linked/isolated/shell cloning and deletions;
- `apply_group_tuning` as one preflighted effect plan and one Undo;
- transaction apply and rollback.

### Vocal and listening gate

After Vocal onboarding:

- perform one integrated `apply_group_tuning` scenario covering Voice/Vocal
  Modes, notes or phonemes, Automation, and Smart Pitch;
- preserve all user-owned note geometry not explicitly targeted;
- account for every gap in notes created by the test;
- start playback and perform a human listening check for audible rendering,
  connected lyric phrases, and absence of unintended gaps.

Artistic quality remains a user judgment. The technical gate verifies that the
requested values reached the intended Group and can be undone once.

### Stage 2 pass criteria

- Every public action has one of the three explicit statuses above.
- No public stable action remains merely `pending` or `sampled`.
- Every supported write has authoritative postconditions and a demonstrated
  recovery path.
- The project is restored to its initial projection after the stage.

## Stage 3: Stability, crash, and sustained-operation gate

### Purpose

Detect intermittent native-host, lifecycle, IPC, and resource failures that
single functional scenarios cannot expose.

### Repetition matrix

The read-only portion has an executable driver. Inspect its redacted schedule
without connecting to SynthV:

```text
npm run validate:v3-reads -- --dry-run
```

After Stage 2 is complete, run the declared 1,000-read matrix only against an
explicit saved disposable project and target:

```text
npm run validate:v3-reads -- --live --stage2-complete --project-file <absolute-svp-path> --track-index <1-based> --group-index <1-based> --note-index <1-based>
```

The driver probes the project, Session and executor identity around every
Query, stops on drift or a 20,000-character/byte response, emits aggregate
timings/counts only, and removes its generated local MusicXML probe. Omitting
`--stage2-complete` makes a 1,000-read live run fail before connection. Smaller
live counts are development smoke only and are not Stage 3 evidence.

The non-read stability slices have a second executable driver. Inspect its
redacted formal plan without connecting to SynthV:

```text
npm run validate:v3-stability -- --dry-run --mode all
```

Live runs require one explicit mode (`concurrency`, `experimental`, `reload`,
or `trace-ab`), the saved disposable project and target, and explicit
`--stage2-complete` acknowledgement at formal counts. Lower `--count` values
are development smoke only. The reload slice verifies both a fresh Session and
write-before-IPC rejection of every old Context. The trace slice starts
separate MCP processes with `SYNTHV_AGENT_TRACE_ENABLED=0/1`, warms each state,
and compares real-host p95 without changing the project.

The dry-run also emits the exact 200-call ordinary write/Undo distribution:
31 verified write Actions, 7 calls for the first 14 and 6 calls for the
remaining 17, so every supported Action exceeds the minimum of three. It also
declares the separate 30 linked-clone/Undo cycles and marks both slices as
requiring visible SynthV Undo; the official scripting API cannot execute Undo.

- 1,000 mixed read-only queries distributed across all 17 Query actions.
- 200 ordinary write/Undo cycles distributed across every supported write
  action, with at least three cycles per action.
- 30 linked clone, 30 isolated clone, and 30 Track-shell clone/restore cycles.
- 100 successful dependent transactions and 100 dependent-preflight failures.
- 30 Bridge reloads and 30 Session-invalidation checks.
- 200 concurrent Node requests, verifying serialized single-writer IPC and no
  request loss or overlap.
- At least one continuous hour of mixed read, write, Undo, reload, and idle
  heartbeat operation.

Run `validate:v3-resources` as a read-only companion to the one-hour soak,
passing the independent soak PowerShell process ID. It samples the visible
SynthV process and Bridge status every minute, records an additional settled
sample 60 seconds after every 20-write/reload batch while the soak holds that
checkpoint and performs no later destructive cycle. The soak may proceed only
after the matching sample is recorded. The gate fails unless all ten batches
and at least five settled-baseline samples are present. Each post-batch and final
working-set/private-byte sample must be within 120% of the settled median;
neither ten-sample batch series may grow monotonically;
heartbeat age must remain within 5 seconds and no processing/control marker may
remain stale for more than 30 seconds. The clean-stop Doctor check remains the
authoritative final IPC-residual check.

The monitor records cold-start samples for diagnosis, but by default only
regular samples taken after at least 10 completed writes are eligible for the
five-sample settled baseline. This enforces the Stage 3 "after warm-up"
criterion instead of comparing a loaded Voice/render working set against an
unloaded process. Batch checkpoints are consumed in exact increments of 20;
advancing past a pending checkpoint or resuming after an unobserved checkpoint
fails closed instead of fabricating a historical settled sample.

For a reduced-stable candidate, an action disabled at the public boundary must
not be re-enabled merely to satisfy the historical native-host repetition
count. The `experimental` driver instead repeats every disabled capability 30
times and repeats both dependent-transaction shapes 100 times each, requiring
`EXPERIMENTAL_CAPABILITY_DISABLED`, `undoRequired=false`, unchanged
project/Session/executor identity, and no project IPC. The still-supported
linked clone remains part of the ordinary write/Undo matrix.

### Crash and recovery criteria

- Zero SynthV native crashes.
- Zero lost or silently overlapping IPC requests.
- Zero automatic retries after claimed-request timeout.
- Zero orphaned request/processing/response files after a clean stop.
- Zero commands that report success when the postcondition differs.
- Every partial-write failure reports exactly one required Undo.
- Crash breadcrumbs are removed after handled success/failure and contain only
  the documented redacted fields.

The prior `0xc0000005` transaction crash blocks stable release unless:

- its reproducible root cause is fixed and the repetition matrix passes; or
- transaction apply/rollback is disabled or clearly removed from the stable
  capability set, after which the remaining matrix passes.

### Performance and resource criteria

- Ordinary real-host operation p95 remains below 300 ms, excluding rendering
  and asynchronous computation completion.
- Trace collection adds less than 5% p95 latency.
- Public response budgets remain satisfied in characters and UTF-8 bytes.
- After warm-up, process memory shows no monotonic growth and returns within
  20% of the settled baseline after each destructive cycle batch.
- Heartbeats do not remain stale beyond the configured recovery window.

## Stage 4: Stable-release decision and delivery

### Purpose

Turn the collected evidence into one unambiguous release decision.

### Release candidates

1. **Full `0.2.0` stable** — all stable actions pass Stages 1–3.
2. **Reduced `0.2.0` stable** — unsafe or unavailable actions are disabled or
   removed from the stable capability set, and all remaining actions pass.
3. **Remain `0.2.0-alpha`** — any native crash, data-integrity defect,
   unrecoverable partial write, privacy leak, or unexplained state drift
   remains.

### Final delivery gate

- Re-run the complete automated gate from a clean checkout.
- Test a clean install and an upgrade over the preceding installed build.
- Verify installation rollback after injected replacement failure.
- Verify that mismatched Node/Lua/Sidebar builds block writes.
- Install the exact release commit and confirm build identity in SynthV.
- Produce a release report with the supported-host matrix, action-status
  matrix, performance distribution, defects, crash evidence, recovery
  evidence, and known limitations.
- Update version, release notes, test matrix, API coverage, and development
  plan only after the evidence supports the selected release candidate.

## Stop conditions

Testing stops immediately when:

- SynthV crashes or stops heartbeating during a command;
- a command returns `undoRequired=true`;
- an unexpected mutation, extra Undo, source-object change, Guard leak, or
  build mismatch occurs;
- the active project is not the declared disposable test copy;
- the Vocal or Vocal Mode context changes during tuning tests.

After a stop, the next action is diagnosis and recovery, not another command.

## Expected outputs

- one executable four-stage test plan;
- one timestamped test evidence report;
- updated action-status and performance matrices;
- defect reports with reproduction and recovery evidence;
- a final Alpha/full-stable/reduced-stable decision.
