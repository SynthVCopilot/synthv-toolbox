# Legacy file IPC protocol v2

Status: unsupported at runtime since 0.2.0-alpha.1. Retained only to explain
historical action payloads while private handlers are migrated.

The Node client and Lua executor use the compact protocol-v2 envelope
exclusively. A protocol-v1 request is rejected with `PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`.

## Protocol v2

Request:

```json
{"v":2,"id":"AbCdEfGh12345678","a":"get_project_info","p":{}}
```

Success:

```json
{"v":2,"id":"AbCdEfGh12345678","r":{}}
```

Error:

```json
{"v":2,"id":"AbCdEfGh12345678","e":{"code":"STALE_NOTE","message":"The note changed"}}
```

The single-writer channel still requires `id` correlation. V2 removes
per-request timestamps, the repeated long field names, and the explicit `ok`
flag. Heartbeat and session files carry timing and supported-version
diagnostics.

The v0.1.4 side-panel handoff is an independent, local display sideband owned
by the Node coordinator, not a second Bridge protocol. Confirmed panel changes
enter SynthV through protocol v2. See [sidebar.md](sidebar.md).

## Indexing and coordinates

- Track, group, and note indices are **1-based**, matching the Lua API.
- Note onset and pitch values are local to their note group.
- Read responses also include absolute onset, end, and pitch after applying group-reference offsets.
- Automation point positions are group-local blicks.
- Smart Pitch anchor positions and curve-point offsets are group-local blicks.
- Editor view time coordinates are blicks and screen coordinates are pixels.
- Playback positions are seconds.

### Automatic note grouping

`add_notes` accepts `grouping=target|ensureNonMain`. The MCP v2 surface injects
`ensureNonMain` by default. When the requested target is a track main group, the
Bridge validates and constructs all notes first, then creates one reusable
library `NoteGroup`, places one non-main reference on the same track, copies the
main reference's Voice/Vocal Modes, and inserts all notes into that group in one
undo record. Existing non-main targets are reused.

Set `grouping=target` to write directly to the requested group. `groupName` may
be provided only when `ensureNonMain` actually creates a group.

Group content belongs to the underlying `NoteGroup`, not to one reference.
Content-mutating actions therefore default to `sharedGroupPolicy=reject`. When
the same Group has more than one reference, the caller must intentionally set
`sharedGroupPolicy=allowAllReferences` and supply the fresh
`expectedReferenceCount`; otherwise the Bridge returns `SHARED_GROUP_WRITE`.
A changed count returns `STALE_GROUP_REFERENCE_COUNT`. Reference-local fields
such as time/pitch offset and mute do not require this all-reference opt-in.

- Time-axis tempo positions are project-global blicks; time-signature positions are zero-based measure numbers.

## Optimistic-concurrency fields

Every write must echo the latest applicable concurrency values:

- `groupUuid` for every Group write.
- `referenceFingerprint` for reference updates/deletes, especially instrumental references without a Group UUID.
- `fingerprint` for note and Smart Pitch edits/deletes.
- `expectedFingerprint` for automation, time-axis, and library-group writes.
- `trackFingerprint` for track updates, clones, deletes, and mixer writes.

The MCP layer additionally supports short `guardToken` and
`expectedGuardToken` values in compact tuning workflows. These tokens are
resolved in memory to the original fingerprint before a file-protocol request
is written, including guarded steps nested in `apply_transaction` and payloads
staged through `sidebar_publish_preview`, so the Lua executor continues to
compare the complete current fingerprint. Guard Tokens are intentionally
invalid after the MCP server restarts or evicts an old entry.

The bridge reports `STALE_GROUP`, `STALE_GROUP_REFERENCE`,
`STALE_LIBRARY_GROUP`, `STALE_NOTE`, `STALE_PITCH_CONTROL`, `STALE_TRACK`,
`STALE_AUTOMATION`, or `STALE_TIME_AXIS` before creating an undo record when a
supplied guard no longer matches.

### MCP v2 surface

The model-facing MCP surface is versioned independently from this file
envelope. By default it exposes `sv_status`, `sv_describe`, `sv_read`,
`sv_edit`, `sv_delete`, `sv_transaction`, `sv_ui`, and `sv_sidebar`.
`sv_describe` returns the existing action schemas only when requested.

Guarded V2 reads may return an opaque `contextId`. The MCP server binds it to
the complete locators and fingerprints already returned by the underlying
action, plus the source action and target kind, then removes those verbose
values from the model-facing result. Locator-only reads do not mint a
write-capable Context. V2 calls expand a handle only for compatible targets:
an incompatible action fails with `CONTEXT_INCOMPATIBLE`, while any explicit
locator or guard that conflicts with the Context fails with
`CONTEXT_SCOPE_MISMATCH`. The server never silently overwrites caller-supplied
scope. A Context does not bypass Lua validation, survive MCP
restart/eviction, or cache mutable musical state.

`get_phrase_context.include` is a file-protocol projection used by the v2
surface. Omitted `include` returns the complete response. When it is present,
excluded voice, automation, analysis, recommendations, selection diagnostics,
and computed-pitch summaries are not serialized and, where possible, are not
computed.

## Serialization rules

- The server accepts exactly one in-flight request.
- Request and response filenames are stable, but writes are published atomically through temporary files.
- `requestId` correlates a response with its request.
- A protocol-version mismatch fails closed.
- New action names and optional payload fields may be added without changing the v2 envelope.
- Unknown fields may be added to read responses in minor releases; clients should ignore fields they do not recognize.

### Compact tuning responses

The `responseMode` payload field accepts `full` or `compact`; `full` is the
default. Compact phoneme reads may also provide
`noteIndices` and/or an absolute `startSeconds`/`endSeconds` overlap range.
Compact writes return counts and fresh fingerprints rather than complete
serialized objects. At the MCP boundary those fingerprints are replaced by
short Guard Tokens.

`includeComputedPhonemes` defaults to `true`. When false, the executor skips
`SV:getPhonemesForGroup` and omits each note's
`computedPhonemes` field. Read responses report `computedPhonemesIncluded`,
`scanMode`, and `scannedNoteCount`; these additive diagnostics let clients
confirm whether an index, page, or time-range fast path was used.

Response mode remains an optional action payload field in both envelopes, and
the Node-only Guard Token substitution is not part of the file IPC contract.

### Phrase context

`get_phrase_context` is an additive read-only v1 action. It accepts an explicit
Group locator or uses the current piano-roll Group when `trackIndex` is absent.
An explicit `noteIndices` list or `startSeconds`/`endSeconds` range wins over
selection; otherwise `preferSelectedNotes` defaults to true. The returned notes
always use compact timing/pitch/phoneme serialization.

The response also contains compact Group voice/Vocal Modes, aggregate phrase
metrics, bounded recommendation-only targets, and summaries for up to eight
requested automation parameters. Optional `pitchAnalysisFrames` samples at most
256 computed-pitch frames but returns only aggregate statistics. At the MCP
boundary, note fingerprints and each nested automation fingerprint become
short Guard Tokens suitable for the existing guarded write tools.

Phrase-note seconds are rounded to the reported `secondsPrecision` of `0.0001`.
When `noteDefaultsOmitted` is true, absent empty phoneme/language/phoneset
overrides, zero detune, true/default even-syllable duration, empty phoneme
attributes, and false selection flags represent their ordinary defaults.
Non-default values are never removed.

The executor recomputes this context for each request. It intentionally does
not cache note, selection, voice, or automation state across requests.

P3 adds optional range controls without changing the v2 envelope:

- `rangeMatch` defaults to `overlap`. This scans from the Group front when
  necessary so notes sustained across a range start are included and reports
  `coverage: "complete_overlap"`.
- `rangeMatch: "onset"` binary-seeks to the first onset at or after the range
  start. Responses report `coverage: "onset_only"` and
  `mayExcludeEarlierSustains: true`.
- An ordinary page with more notes contains a raw `pageCursor` in file IPC. The
  MCP server replaces it with `page.cursorToken`; on continuation it restores
  the exact Group locator, next index, and boundary fingerprint. A changed
  boundary fails with `STALE_RANGE_CURSOR`. Tokens do not survive MCP restart or
  eviction.
- `ranges` accepts 1–32 `{startSeconds,endSeconds,label?}` objects and cannot be
  combined with top-level time bounds, exact note indices, a cursor, or a
  non-zero offset. The result contains one shared unique `notes` array and
  per-range `noteIndices`, diagnostics, automation summaries, and optional
  pitch summaries. The union is bounded to 256 notes and pitch sampling is
  bounded to 256 total requested frames.

Clients that omit these optional fields retain complete overlap matching and
numeric pagination.

### Action catalog

Protocol v2 permits new file-IPC action names without changing the
request/response envelope. The catalog also contains bounded Node-local actions
that are routed through the compact MCP surface but never sent over file IPC.
The action set includes reusable note-group library
operations, linked/deep group references, Smart Pitch CRUD, Bridge-tracked
Retakes, automation sampling/simplification, full selection control, viewport
navigation, host clipboard/dialog helpers, coordinate conversion, and
namespaced script data. Other actions expose typed Group voice/Vocal
Mode settings, host-validated experimental Unison fields, and dedicated
per-note phoneme properties. The catalog also includes `apply_transaction`,
`rollback_transaction`,
`create_harmony_track`, `humanize_notes`, `apply_expression_preset`, and
`fit_lyrics`. `get_phrase_context` provides compact selected/ranged phrase
analysis.

`clone_track` defaults to `nonMainGroupPolicy=reject` when the source contains
non-main vocal Groups. Explicit `detach` creates independent Group content, but
the official API cannot verify or assign those non-main Vocal database
identities, so the result requires manual Vocal review. `clone_track_shell`
host-clones only the source main Vocal context into one verified-empty track and
reports `vocalIdentityReadable=false`; it does not claim a readable singer name.

`get_script_data` lists or reads keys beginning with `synthv-agent-bridge.`;
`script_data` sets or removes keys in the same namespace. Neither action lists,
clears, or overwrites another script's namespace. `record_ai_usage` is the
typed Track-scoped writer for `synthv-agent-bridge.aiUsageDisclosure.v1`.

### Guarded transactions

`apply_transaction` uses the protocol-v2 envelope:

```json
{
  "v": 2,
  "id": "AbCdEfGh12345678",
  "a": "apply_transaction",
  "p": {
    "summary": "Create and then rename a track",
    "steps": [
      {"action": "add_track", "payload": {"name": "Draft"}},
      {
        "action": "update_track",
        "payload": {
          "trackIndex": {"$result": {"step": 1, "path": ["trackIndex"]}},
          "trackFingerprint": {"$result": {"step": 1, "path": ["fingerprint"]}},
          "name": "Lead"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The batch contains 1–32 non-transaction project-write steps. The Bridge
fully preflights every independent step before one undo record is created.
Independent validation failure leaves the project unchanged. A complete field
value in a later step may use
`{"$result":{"step":1,"path":["trackIndex"]}}` to read an earlier 1-based
forward result; it cannot refer to the current or a future step. Dependent
steps are resolved from actual results and preflighted immediately before they
execute, because their targets do not yet exist during the initial pass.
Conflicting steps that mutate the same guarded scope are rejected. Track and
library-group deletes, which shift later indices, must be the only step.

All forward writes share one native undo record. This is reported as
`atomicity: "singleUndoRecord"`; it is not an automatic rollback guarantee. A
dependent validation or unexpected host error may happen after earlier steps
have written. `TRANSACTION_EXECUTION_FAILED` identifies the failed step and
reports `partialWritePossible` and `undoRequired`; when Undo is required, the
caller must ask the user to invoke SynthV Undo once before rereading or
retrying.

Optional `rollbackSteps` may also refer to a forward result. Resolved reverse
steps are stored only in the current Bridge session.
`rollback_transaction` accepts the returned `transactionId`, revalidates
current fingerprints, and creates one new undo record.

### Local MusicXML and MIDI import

`inspect_score_file` and `import_monophonic_score` are Node-local catalog
actions rather than file-IPC actions. Both accept only an absolute local path
ending in `.xml`, `.musicxml`, `.mxl`, `.mid`, or `.midi`. URLs, `.svp`, XML
`DOCTYPE`/`ENTITY`, unsafe or ambiguous `.mxl` containers, and malformed input
are rejected. Inspection makes no SynthV write and returns:

- a SHA-256 `fileFingerprint` over the exact source bytes;
- 1-based MusicXML part/voice/staff or MIDI track/channel choices;
- overlap/polyphony diagnostics and a bounded converted-note preview; and
- the source tempo map as review-only metadata.

Import requires the fresh hash as `expectedFileFingerprint` and the literal
`rightsConfirmed: true`. The selected lane must be unambiguous and monophonic,
and the SynthV write is capped at 512 notes. The Node process converts the lane
to Group-local blick notes, then calls the same guarded `add_notes` path and
shared-Group firewall as an ordinary edit. It never applies the source tempo to
the project automatically.

### Track color compatibility

- Track write actions accept `#RRGGBB`, `AARRGGBB`, or `#AARRGGBB`.
- Six-digit RGB is normalized to an opaque native SynthV value by prepending `ff` and removing `#`.
- Track reads keep the host's raw `displayColor` and may additionally include `displayColorArgb` and `displayColorRgb`.
- A color write is verified through `Track:getDisplayColor()` before it is reported as successful.

### Verified time-axis writes

`set_time_axis` explicitly removes an occupied tempo/time-signature position
before adding its replacement. The bridge validates the complete operation on a
cloned `TimeAxis`, applies one undo record, and verifies the project-owned
`TimeAxis` afterward. Successful responses include `verified: true`.

### Token-efficient Group Voice refresh

`get_group_voice` accepts either an explicit Group locator or an empty payload.
An empty payload resolves the current piano-roll vocal Group, avoiding a
potentially large `get_selection` response merely to discover the target. On
the MCP v2 surface, the default projection contains only `trackIndex`,
`groupIndex`, documented `parameters`, `vocalModes`, and a guarded `contextId`.
Callers can request additional fields explicitly for diagnostics.

The Agent rule requires one first-use notice per conversation, not one
notice per edit. Before Vocal Mode work, the Agent asks the user to
select the intended Note Group, select or assign its singer, and then provide
either the exact current singer mode names or a screenshot of that panel.
Vocal Mode names cannot appear before a singer is selected. The Agent reuses
that list until the user reports changing singer. Undo or a manual edit only
requires a compact reread when it touched the same target.

### Optional host capabilities

When the current SynthV Lua host cannot execute `Note:setPitchAutoMode()`, a
request that would actually change the note fails with
`UNSUPPORTED_HOST_CAPABILITY`. A request matching the current value succeeds
without invoking the unavailable setter.

`set_group_voice` treats `singers` and `spacing` as experimental host
capabilities because they are not in the public `NoteGroupReference#getVoice`
field list. It accepts them only when the current reference returns the field,
and it verifies the requested value on a cloned reference before creating an
undo record.

Vocal Mode pitch, timbre, and pronunciation axes accept `0..150`. SynthV may
omit every default Vocal Mode from
`getVoice()` until a non-default value is written, so an empty
`vocalModeParams` map is not treated as a capability catalog. The caller may
submit all desired mode names in one `set_group_voice` request. The Bridge
tries the complete batch on a cloned reference and reads it back; no
interactive per-mode discovery request is required. Names rejected by the
current host fail before an undo record, while successful non-default values
become visible in later reads.

If clone validation returns `VOCAL_MODE_NOT_FOUND`, its details contain
`requiredUserInput.kind=vocal_mode_names`, the attempted names, any names
already visible in the Group, and an instruction to stop guessing. The Agent
must tell the user that the scripting API cannot enumerate the current
singer's default-only modes and ask the user to select the intended Note Group,
select or assign its singer, and provide the exact names displayed in SynthV's
Vocal Mode panel, preserving spelling and capitalization. The user may instead
attach a screenshot that clearly shows the complete panel. The Agent should
then retry all identified names in one batch and reuse them for that singer.

The Bridge first tries a sparse nested update and verifies every previously
visible Vocal Mode value, so an unrequested pre-existing value is never silently
clamped. A directly requested value must still survive
`NoteGroupReference:setVoice()` on a cloned reference. The TypeScript and Lua
bound prevents values above 150 from reaching that preflight.

### Tuning parameter ranges

The Bridge does not perform exploratory range writes at startup or at the
beginning of a conversation. Stable public or verified ranges are validated in
TypeScript and Lua:

| Scope | Parameter | Accepted range |
|---|---|---:|
| Group Voice | loudness | `-48..12` dB |
| Group Voice | tension, breathiness, gender, tone shift | `-1..1` |
| Group Voice | Vocal Mode pitch/timbre/pronunciation | `0..150` |
| Phoneme | position, activity | `0..1` |
| Phoneme | strength | `-1..1` |
| Phoneme | left offset | finite seconds; no Bridge-imposed bound |
| Expression preset | strength | `0..2` |

Automation is intentionally different: `Automation:getDefinition().range` is
the authority for each current Group, host, and voice. The existing
fingerprint/Guard read already returns this definition, so no separate probe is
needed. SynthV Studio 2.2.1 was verified to return `pitchDelta -1200..1200`,
`vibratoEnv 0..2`, `loudness -48..24`, `tension/breathiness/gender -2..2`,
`voicing 0..1`, `toneShift -800..800`, `mouthOpening -1..1`,
`rapIntonation 0..1`, and current singer `vocalMode_<Name> -150..150`.
Because these live ranges differ from older public tables, the Bridge validates
automation point values against the host-returned definition rather than a
duplicated fixed list.

Clone-only SynthV 2.2.1 verification also confirmed phoneme
`position/activity 0..1`, `strength -1..1`, and unchanged `leftOffset` values
through at least `-10..10` seconds. Generic note attributes remain
host-validated finite values unless a semantic action has a narrower contract;
for example, `apply_expression_preset` deliberately limits its strength to
`0..2`.

### Same-Group tuning batch

`apply_group_tuning` accepts an optional Group Voice/Vocal Mode change,
fingerprint-guarded note edits with optional phoneme changes, and up to 32
fingerprint-guarded automation updates for one Group. It resolves and validates
the complete payload—including every current fingerprint and every
host-returned automation range—before `Project:newUndoRecord()`, then applies
the pass as exactly one SynthV undo record. Prefer it over several sequential
writes when one tuning decision affects the same Group. SynthV's public
scripting API does not expose Undo. If the host unexpectedly rejects execution
after that undo boundary, the Bridge returns `undoRequired`,
`partialWritePossible`, and one-step Undo guidance; callers must not retry until
the user undoes once and the target is reread.

### Deterministic note transform batch

`transform_notes` applies one explicit numeric transform to 1–512
fingerprint-guarded notes in the same Group. Supported fields are
`onsetOffsetBlick` or `onsetOffsetSeconds` (mutually exclusive),
`durationScale`, `durationOffsetBlick`, and `pitchOffsetSemitones`.
The duration calculation is
`round(originalDuration * durationScale) + durationOffsetBlick`.

A seconds onset offset converts every current absolute onset through the fresh
project `TimeAxis`, adds the requested number of seconds, converts back to
blicks, and keeps the original duration unit in blicks. The complete batch is
rejected before its undo boundary if any target is stale or any resulting
onset, duration, or MIDI pitch is invalid. Successful writes use the existing
`edit_notes` clone preflight, create one undo record, and verify the retained
values afterward.

On MCP v2, callers may pass `target: "contextNotes"` with a fresh
`contextId`. The TypeScript layer expands exactly the note guards returned by
that read and removes the compact alias before file IPC. This is a transport
optimization, not target inference: the Agent still chooses the read scope and
the explicit numeric transform.

### Hot reload

`reload_bridge` compiles the currently running script file with Lua
`loadfile()`, writes the correlated response, and then transfers polling to a
new in-session Bridge instance. It does not call UI automation or inject hooks.
The installer can request the same transition through the
`synthv-agent-bridge.reload` marker, records the installed absolute path in a
local `synthv-agent-bridge.install.json` manifest with `schemaVersion: 1`, and
confirms that the session token changed. This manifest schema is independent
from file IPC protocol v2. The fallback is needed because SynthV 2.2.1 does not
expose the loaded script path to Lua. A Bridge version that predates this action
must be restarted manually once before later installs can reload automatically.

The MCP v2 surface tracks the heartbeat `sessionToken`. When SynthV restarts or
the Bridge hot-reloads, the next v2 call automatically detects the changed
token and clears every cached `contextId` and Guard Token. A write is rejected
with `SYNTHV_SESSION_CHANGED` and `requiredAction=read_target_again`; a fresh
read without an old context proceeds and includes `sessionReset` in its result.
When `sv_status` requests the reload itself, it waits for the new heartbeat
token and clears those caches before returning, so an immediate follow-up
cannot enter the acknowledgement-to-heartbeat race window.
This makes the reset explicit to the Agent without attempting to restart the
SynthV application. Automatically restarting SynthV is intentionally out of
scope because it can interrupt unsaved work; the safe automatic behavior is
cache invalidation followed by a fresh guarded read.

### Selection-aware writes

Group voice and phoneme reads include whether the target is the current
piano-roll Group, whether it is selected in either editor, and how many of its
notes are selected. `set_group_voice` can require the current editor Group;
`set_note_phoneme_properties` can additionally require every target note to be
selected. These guards are opt-in because official object setters operate on
explicit Group UUIDs, note indices, and fingerprints without requiring UI
selection. This keeps batch automation available while allowing
selection-sensitive user requests to fail safely with `SELECTION_MISMATCH`.

UI write responses report observed host state. `set_selection` rereads and
returns `get_selection`; `set_editor_view` serializes the resulting navigation
state in addition to the requested fields; and `playback` returns the current
SynthV status and playhead after the command. Callers should use those observed
fields instead of assuming the host retained every requested value exactly.
