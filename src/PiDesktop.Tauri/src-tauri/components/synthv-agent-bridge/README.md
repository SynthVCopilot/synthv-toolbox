# SynthV Agent Bridge

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

A local [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets compatible AI clients inspect and control the project currently open in **Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro**.

The bridge uses Synthesizer V's public Lua scripting API. It does **not** parse or rewrite `.svp` files, open a network port, or call an AI API by itself.

## What it can do

| Area | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Project inspection | Read project metadata, tracks, library Groups, notes, selections, tempo/time-signature maps, computed phonemes and pitch, automation, mixer state, and editor context. |
| Notes and lyrics | Add, edit, delete, clone, transpose, or humanize guarded notes; fit lyrics and edit language, singing/rap type, timing, detune, and note attributes. |
| Voice and phonemes | Read and edit Group Voice, Vocal Mode axes, experimental Unison fields, phoneset overrides, syllable timing, pronunciation, and per-phoneme timing or strength. |
| Pitch and expression | Adjust pitch transitions and pitch curves; manage Smart Pitch controls and AI Retakes; apply scoop, falloff, vibrato, crescendo, or breathiness presets. |
| Automation | Read, add, replace, sample, simplify, or clear pitch deviation, loudness, tension, breathiness, voicing, gender, and Vocal Mode curves. |
| Tracks, Groups, and harmony | Create, clone, reuse, update, or delete library Groups, Group references, and tracks; create an empty host-cloned Vocal template track; and create range-constrained harmony tracks. Shared Group content writes fail closed unless all references are explicitly acknowledged. |
| Local score import | Inspect an explicitly supplied local MusicXML (`.xml`, `.musicxml`, `.mxl`) or SMF MIDI (`.mid`, `.midi`) file, then import one rights-confirmed monophonic lane through the guarded note-write path. URLs and `.svp` files are not accepted. |
| Timing, editor, and playback | Convert seconds, quarter notes, and blicks; edit tempo/time signatures; control selection, viewport, clipboard, grid snapping, coordinates, mixer, and playback. |
| Plugin data and provenance | Read and write Bridge-owned namespaced Script Data through SynthV's persistent object storage, and record an explicit AI-usage disclosure on a guarded Track. |
| Safe editing | Protect writes with fresh fingerprints, typed/scope-bound `contextId` values, and Guard Tokens; fully preflight independent transaction steps, resolve forward dependencies just in time, create one SynthV undo record, and optionally retain a guarded rollback plan. |
| Connection and local privacy | Monitor Bridge/MCP heartbeats and hot-reload an online Bridge from the optional native side panel. File IPC stays local: the Bridge does not parse `.svp` files, open a network port, or call an AI API. |

> To avoid reproducible SynthV 2.2.1 native crashes, the current stable surface rejects
> isolated Group clone, Note Group/Track/Track-shell clone, harmony Track, and
> transaction apply/rollback before project IPC. The table describes the full
> design surface, not current availability of those experimental paths. Linked
> Group-reference clone remains available.

## Responsibility boundaries

The Bridge separates musical judgment from deterministic execution. The Agent
decides **why, where, and how much** to change. The MCP and Lua layers execute
that explicit decision compactly, safely, and against current SynthV state.
SynthV stores the result, and the user makes the final listening decision.

| Work | Owner | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Understand user intent, lyric emotion, and singing style | Agent | Requires language and musical-semantic judgment |
| Decide which words to strengthen, soften, lengthen, or connect with pitch transitions | Agent | This is an artistic decision |
| Ask for the current Vocal and every Vocal Mode name | Agent + user | The official API cannot read Vocal identity or enumerate untouched default-only Vocal Modes |
| Decide whether to tune a short phrase or a larger scope | Agent | Depends on the goal, review cost, and token budget |
| Convert terms such as warm, restrained, or bright into explicit parameters | Agent | The Bridge must not interpret artistic language |
| Choose a fresh target scope and explicit numeric batch transform | Agent | Target selection and musical values belong to the current task |
| Choose a legal local score and confirm the right to import it | Agent + user | The Bridge cannot determine copyright or license authority |
| Provide current Group, note, Voice, and automation data | Lua Bridge | SynthV's live object model is authoritative |
| Cache and expand typed, scope-bound `contextId` and Guard data | TypeScript MCP | Avoids repeating large fingerprints while failing closed on incompatible scope |
| Inspect and convert an explicitly supplied local MusicXML/MIDI lane | TypeScript MCP | Keeps bounded local parsing outside SynthV without implying permission to use the file |
| Project compact reads and minimal write acknowledgements | TypeScript MCP | Keeps irrelevant host data out of the model context |
| Detect SynthV restart or Bridge reload | TypeScript MCP | Old Context and Guard data must be invalidated before another write |
| Validate request structure, routing, indices, and stable protocol ranges | TypeScript MCP | Rejects malformed work before file IPC |
| Read the current Automation `definition.range` | Lua Bridge | The range can vary with the host, voice, and parameter |
| Expand deterministic note transforms and other batch mechanics | Lua Bridge | Mechanical calculations should be centralized and reproducible |
| Validate fingerprints and the complete prepared batch | Lua Bridge | Prevents overwriting user edits or partially applying invalid work |
| Block accidental edits to multiply referenced Note Group content | Lua Bridge | Group content is shared even when references appear on different tracks |
| Create one undo record and verify host postconditions | Lua Bridge + SynthV | Provides one recovery boundary and avoids false success |
| Save, audition, undo, and approve the final result | User + SynthV | The user is the final artistic authority |

See the detailed [Agent / MCP responsibility boundaries](docs/responsibility-boundaries.md)
for the enforced layer rules and batch-operation admission criteria.

## First MCP connection: user notice

On the first project-changing use in a conversation, the Agent must briefly
tell the user:

- An optional guided Demo is available. Reply `Run the Twinkle Star demo.` to
  create and tune an isolated example without changing existing material. The
  Agent prints five short progress headings and pauses once for Vocal/Vocal
  Mode onboarding because of the official API limitation.
- Save important work before AI editing and avoid changing the same target
  while a Bridge write is running.
- After undoing or manually editing the notes, Group, Voice, or Vocal Modes
  that the Agent is about to change, the Agent will compactly reread only that
  target. Unrelated edits do not require a reread.
- SynthV's scripting API does not expose the current singer identity or
  enumerate untouched default-only Vocal Mode names and parameters. Only when a
  request uses or changes Vocal Modes, the Agent asks the user to select the
  intended Note Group and Vocal, then provide every exact singing style or a
  screenshot of the complete Vocal Mode panel. Explicit mechanical edits that
  do not depend on singing styles do not require this handoff. After the Vocal
  changes, the styles must be provided again before another Vocal-Mode-dependent
  write.
- The Agent does not display a fixed **How to use** section or preflight
  checklist. It asks only for missing user-owned decisions, suggests saving a
  working copy once, and shows a small preview before writing. Fresh reads,
  guards, preflight, and verification stay internal. Undo guidance appears only
  when an actual result reports `undoRequired: true`.
- Users may request **token-saving mode**. For an ordinary command that returns
  `verified: true`, the Agent then skips its extra independent post-write query.
  The fresh target read and all Bridge-side validation and host postcondition
  checks remain enabled; required recovery, dependent-step, UI-state, and Demo
  reads are not skipped.

When Vocal Mode information is needed, a concise prompt from the user is
sufficient:

```text
Current singer Vocal Modes: Airy, Bright, Cool, Dark, Emotional, Power, Solid,
Sweet.
```

Alternatively, attach a screenshot that clearly shows the complete Vocal Mode
panel.

File IPC is deliberately used for the first version because it works within SynthV's documented Lua environment and is easy to inspect and recover. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

Local score inspection is the bounded exception to the Node server's
project-data pass-through role: it reads only an explicitly supplied absolute
MusicXML/MIDI path. Inspection stays in Node; an approved import sends converted
notes through the same guarded Lua `add_notes` path. It never parses `.svp`.

## Requirements

- Synthesizer V Studio **2 Pro 2.1.2 or later**.
- Node.js **20.10 or later**.
- An MCP host that supports local stdio servers. Codex and Claude Code have maintained project profiles in this repository.

This project targets the scripting environment in Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro; it does not target the Basic edition.

## Installation

New users can follow the end-to-end [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) or
[中文快速开始](docs/quickstart_cn.md). It covers cloning the repository,
Node.js setup, script installation, host-specific MCP registration, and
connection verification. Agent skills and guided musical workflows are installed
separately from [`SynthVCopilot/SKILLS`](https://github.com/SynthVCopilot/SKILLS).

### 1. Build the MCP server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynthVCopilot/synthv-agent-bridge.git
cd synthv-agent-bridge
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Install the SynthV scripts

In Synthesizer V Studio, use **Scripts → Open Scripts Folder**, then pass that directory to the installer:

```bash
npm run install:synthv -- --target "/path/to/Synthesizer V Studio 2/scripts"
```

The installer copies these files into a `SynthV Agent Bridge` subfolder of the directory you selected:

- `SynthVAgentBridge.lua`
- `StopSynthVAgentBridge.lua`
- `SynthVAgentSidebar.lua` (optional)

Alternatively, set `SYNTHV_SCRIPTS_DIR` to the scripts directory before running
`npm run install:synthv`. The installer creates a `SynthV Agent Bridge`
subfolder. When the side-panel file changes, close and reopen SynthV so it
reloads **SynthV Agent** as a custom side-panel section. **Scripts → Rescan**
may leave an already-rendered panel layout unchanged. After reopening, run
**Start SynthV Agent Bridge** once.

The Bridge and every ordinary MCP read/write tool work without the side panel.
For a core-only installation, add `--without-sidebar`; this skips the optional
panel without deleting an existing installation:

```bash
npm run install:synthv -- --target "/path/to/scripts" --without-sidebar
```

If a hot-reload-capable Bridge session is already running, the installer asks
it to load the copied Lua file and waits for a new session heartbeat. This uses
the Bridge's file IPC and Lua `loadfile()`—not UI automation or hooks. Use
`--no-reload` to copy without requesting a reload. The first installation of a
hot-reload-capable version must still be started manually once. A changed
side-panel layout requires closing and reopening SynthV, so the Bridge also
needs one manual start afterward. SynthV may reuse cached menu-script code
after a project or
app restart, so when the Bridge runtime itself changed, the installer also
asks for one **Scripts → Rescan** before the next manual start. Hot reload keeps
the current session usable until then.

### 3. Start the in-editor bridge

In Synthesizer V Studio, run:

```text
Scripts → SynthV Agent Bridge → Start SynthV Agent Bridge
```

The script remains active and writes a heartbeat while SynthV is running. To
stop only the Bridge, run **Stop SynthV Agent Bridge**; the side panel remains
alive and shows `B offline`. SynthV's **Abort All Running Scripts** also stops
the side panel itself, so the already-rendered panel freezes and neither its
status nor its buttons can update. Reopen SynthV afterward to restore it.

### 4. Connect an MCP host

Both maintained adapters launch the same `node dist/src/cli.js` Runtime and keep
registration scoped to this project:

- [Codex profile](docs/hosts/codex.md): `.codex/config.toml`
- [Claude Code profile](docs/hosts/claude-code.md): `.mcp.json`

Other local MCP hosts can use the same command when they support **STDIO**
servers. No installer or Doctor command writes user-global host configuration.

### Optional native connection panel

The side panel shows Bridge (`B`) and MCP (`M`) connection states on separate
rows plus **Restart Bridge**. It does not collect instructions, preview changes,
or apply edits. `B` becomes online only after the panel observes a new
heartbeat, and Restart Bridge waits for a replacement Session. A permanent
warning explains that **Abort All Running Scripts** freezes the displayed
states; use the dedicated Stop command when only the Bridge should stop. Start
an offline Bridge from the Scripts menu. See [docs/sidebar.md](docs/sidebar.md).

### 5. Verify the connection

Open an MCP-enabled conversation and ask it to call `sv_status`, followed by
`sv_query` with `action: "get_project_info"` and
`contextMode: "readOnly"`. A healthy status contains:

```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "fresh": true
}
```

## MCP v3 tools

The public MCP surface exposes six stable tools. Individual SynthV actions
and their full schemas are returned just in time by `sv_describe`, rather than
placing every action schema in the model context.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sv_status` | Read connection, Session, capability, trace, and component-build status. |
| `sv_describe` | List actions or return one compact Query/Command/UI/Review schema. |
| `sv_query` | Run a read projection and create a `readOnly` or `writeIntent` Context. |
| `sv_command` | Run validated edit, delete, clone, import, or bounded batch commands. |
| `sv_ui` | Control selection, viewport, clipboard, dialogs, snapping, coordinates, or playback. |
| `sv_review` | Read optional Sidebar connection and runtime status. |

The normal tuning sequence is:

1. Call `sv_describe` for unfamiliar actions.
2. Read current state with `sv_query`; use `contextMode: "writeIntent"` before
   a project command.
3. Reuse the returned `contextId` in one `sv_command`.
4. Query again after an unknown Context, Session change, or any `STALE_*`
   result.

`contextId` stores only locators and concurrency guards in bounded Node memory.
Each handle is bound to a target kind and source scope. Reusing it with an
incompatible action, or combining it with a conflicting explicit locator or
guard, fails closed instead of silently retargeting the call. Locator-only
`readOnly` Contexts do not authorize writes. A `writeIntent` Context is minted
only from a fresh host read. SynthV still checks every complete private
fingerprint before creating an Undo record.

Phrase reads accept an `include` projection over `notes`, `voice`,
`automation`, `analysis`, `recommendations`, `pitchAnalysis`, `selection`, and
`diagnostics`. The v3 default is `notes`, `voice`, and `analysis`. Results with
at least 24 notes use a column/row representation when `dense: "auto"`; use
`dense: "never"` for ordinary objects. V3 note rows omit derivable absolute
end positions and report `noteDefaults.absolutePitch: "pitch"` when equal
absolute/local pitches were omitted.

Collection reads are bounded by default and return page/continuation metadata.
This includes Tracks, library Groups, time-axis marks, Track Groups/notes, computed
performance data, and Smart Pitch controls. Automation defaults to a compact
full-curve summary and returns point arrays only for an explicitly requested
closed range. An unscoped default Query above the 20,000-character response
budget fails with narrowing guidance instead of flooding the Agent context.

### Action catalog

These actions are routed internally through the six MCP v3 tools. They are
not registered as standalone MCP tools; request their current schemas through
`sv_describe` only when needed.

| Action | Access | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `bridge_status` | Read | Read the heartbeat without requiring a round trip. |
| `sidebar_status` | Read | Read the MCP heartbeat and optional native side-panel runtime status. |
| `ping` | Read | Test the complete Node → Lua → Node path. |
| `reload_bridge` | Control | Reload the installed Lua Bridge in the current script session. |
| `get_host_info` | Read | SynthV host version, OS, language, project, and IPC information. |
| `host_clipboard` | Control | Read or write text through SynthV's host clipboard API. |
| `show_dialog` | Control | Show message, input, confirmation, or custom-form dialogs. |
| `convert_pitch` | Read | Convert MIDI pitch and frequency and identify black keys. |
| `get_project_info` | Read | Project, timing, playback, host, and current editor location. |
| `inspect_score_file` | Read | Inspect an explicitly supplied local MusicXML or SMF MIDI file in Node, return a SHA-256 file guard and selectable parts/voices/staves or tracks/channels, and preview a bounded monophonic lane without changing SynthV. |
| `get_time_axis` | Read | Bounded, independently paged tempo/time-signature marks; private full-state guards are captured behind Contexts. |
| `convert_time` | Read | Convert seconds, quarter notes, or blicks through the current tempo map, with optional Blick-grid rounding. |
| `set_time_axis` | Destructive | Add, replace, or remove tempo/time-signature marks. |
| `list_tracks` | Read | A bounded page of Track summaries, Group/note counts, and mixer state. |
| `list_note_groups` | Read | A bounded page of reusable library Group summaries and reference counts; private identities and guards remain Context-backed. |
| `create_note_group` | Write | Create an optionally populated reusable library group. |
| `clone_note_group` | Write | Deep-clone a track or library group into the library. |
| `delete_note_group` | Destructive | Delete a library group and all references to it. |
| `add_group_reference` | Write | Place a library group on a track. |
| `clone_group_reference` | Write | Make a linked or deep-copied reference on another track. |
| `get_track_notes` | Read | Independently bounded Group and note pages with attributes and offsets; private Group/note guards remain Context-backed. |
| `get_group_voice` | Read | Typed group voice defaults, Vocal Modes, experimental Unison fields, and target selection context. |
| `get_note_phoneme_data` | Read | User/computed phonemes, phoneset overrides, per-phoneme attributes, and note selection state, with optional compact note-index or seconds-range filtering. |
| `get_phrase_context` | Read | One compact, write-ready selected/ranged phrase read with note and automation Guard Tokens, voice/Vocal Modes, diagnostics, and recommendation-only review targets. |
| `get_selection` | Read | Selected groups, notes, Smart Pitch controls, and requested automation points. |
| `set_selection` | Control | Replace, add, remove, or clear editor selections and return the selection actually reported by SynthV. |
| `get_computed_group_data` | Read | Computed phonemes/rap attributes and optional pitch samples. |
| `add_track` | Write | Create a track and return its main Group locator. |
| `update_track` | Write | Rename, recolor, or change Render Panel inclusion. |
| `clone_track` | Write | Host-clone a track's main Vocal context with optional clear/transpose. A source containing non-main vocal Groups is rejected by default; `nonMainGroupPolicy=detach` makes their Group content independent, but their non-main Vocal identities must be reviewed manually. |
| `clone_track_shell` | Write | Host-clone the source track's main Vocal context into one verified-empty track, removing notes, pitch controls, known automation, non-main Groups, and—by default—mixer state. The API cannot read or name the inherited Vocal identity. |
| `delete_track` | Destructive | Delete a fingerprint-verified non-final track. |
| `update_group` | Write | Change vocal/instrumental reference state and supported vocal properties. |
| `set_group_voice` | Write | Fingerprint-verified typed voice, Vocal Mode, and host-validated experimental Unison updates, with an optional current-Group guard. |
| `apply_group_tuning` | Destructive | Prevalidate and apply one same-Group Voice/Vocal Mode, note/phoneme, and multi-automation tuning pass in one undo record. Unexpected execution failures explicitly require one SynthV Undo before retrying. |
| `delete_group_reference` | Destructive | Remove a non-main vocal or instrumental reference. |
| `import_monophonic_score` | Write | Import at most 512 notes from one freshly inspected, rights-confirmed local MusicXML/MIDI lane through guarded `add_notes`; the SHA-256 guard must match and source tempo is reported but not applied. |
| `add_notes` | Write | Add notes to a target group. V2 defaults to `grouping=ensureNonMain`, creating a reusable non-main group/reference when the target is the track main group; use `grouping=target` to write to the exact group. |
| `edit_notes` | Write | Edit fingerprint-verified notes. |
| `transform_notes` | Destructive | Apply one explicit guarded batch offset/scale to note onset, duration, or pitch. V2 can transform every note in a fresh Context without repeating indices. |
| `set_note_phoneme_properties` | Write | Edit fingerprint/Guard-verified phoneme, phoneset, syllable, timing, and strength properties, with optional compact acknowledgement and current-Group/selected-note guards. |
| `delete_notes` | Destructive | Delete fingerprint-verified notes. |
| `get_note_retakes` | Read | Read take count and Bridge-tracked Take IDs. |
| `generate_note_retake` | Write | Generate duration, pitch, or timbre variations. |
| `activate_note_retake` | Write | Activate the default or a Bridge-tracked Take. |
| `delete_note_retake` | Destructive | Delete a Bridge-tracked non-default Take. |
| `get_pitch_controls` | Read | Read point and curve Smart Pitch objects and fingerprints. |
| `add_pitch_controls` | Write | Add point or curve Smart Pitch objects. |
| `edit_pitch_controls` | Write | Edit fingerprint-verified Smart Pitch objects. |
| `delete_pitch_controls` | Destructive | Delete fingerprint-verified Smart Pitch objects. |
| `get_automation` | Read | Read a parameter definition and control points, optionally returning a compact Guard Token instead of the verbose curve fingerprint. |
| `sample_automation` | Read | Sample native or linear curve values at requested positions. |
| `simplify_automation` | Destructive | Remove insignificant points in a curve range. |
| `set_automation_points` | Write | Add/update fingerprint/Guard-verified points, optionally clearing all or a range first and returning a compact acknowledgement. |
| `clear_automation` | Destructive | Clear a complete curve or a selected range. |
| `get_editor_view` | Read | Read editor time/value ranges and pixel scales. |
| `set_editor_view` | Control | Move or scale the main-editor or arrangement viewport and return the host's resulting navigation state. |
| `snap_position` | Read | Snap a position using current editor grid settings. |
| `convert_editor_coordinates` | Read | Convert time/value and x/y editor coordinates. |
| `get_script_data` | Read | List or read namespaced Bridge JSON plugin data on SynthV objects. |
| `script_data` | Write | Set or remove namespaced Bridge JSON plugin data on SynthV objects. |
| `record_ai_usage` | Write | Store a versioned AI-usage disclosure on a fingerprint-guarded Track. |
| `get_track_mixer` | Read | Read gain, pan, mute, and solo. |
| `set_track_mixer` | Write | Change gain, pan, mute, and solo. |
| `apply_transaction` | Destructive | Apply up to 32 writes in one undo record. Independent steps are fully preflighted; later steps may consume earlier results with `$result` and are preflighted just in time. This is a single-Undo recovery boundary, not automatic rollback. |
| `rollback_transaction` | Destructive | Apply the stored guarded reverse steps for a transaction in one new undo record. |
| `create_harmony_track` | Write | Clone a guarded vocal track, transpose it, octave-fit an optional voice range, and set its mixer. |
| `humanize_notes` | Destructive | Apply deterministic fingerprint-guarded onset/duration variation, optionally preserving chord alignment. |
| `apply_expression_preset` | Destructive | Apply scoop, falloff, vibrato, crescendo, or breathiness through note attributes or automation. |
| `fit_lyrics` | Destructive | Assign syllables and optional phonemes to fingerprint-verified notes. |
| `playback` | Control | Read status, play, pause, stop, seek, or loop, then return the host's observed status and playhead. |

All track, group, and note indices are **1-based**, matching the SynthV Lua API. Note and automation coordinates are group-local blicks unless the returned field explicitly says `absolute`. Playback positions are seconds.

### Compact tuning responses

`get_note_phoneme_data`, `get_automation`, and `sample_automation` accept
`responseMode: "compact"`. Full mode remains the default.

- `get_track_notes` compacts its nested `groups[].notes` on the `sv_query`
  projection path. Blick and quarter duplicates of the same position
  (`absoluteOnset`, `absoluteEnd`, `absoluteEndSeconds`, `endPosition`,
  `onsetQuarters`, `durationQuarters`) are dropped in favor of group-local
  `onset`/`duration` plus `absoluteOnsetSeconds`/`absoluteDurationSeconds`, and
  a group of 24 or more notes is returned as `{columns, rows}` with
  `noteFormat: "rows"`. Note guards are captured before projection, so
  `contextId` stays valid.
- `sv_query.fields` filters top-level keys of the result root only. Nested
  collections such as `groups[].notes` are not column-filtered; asking for note
  field names returns just the envelope plus a `projectionWarning` listing the
  root keys that were actually available.

- Prefer `get_phrase_context` before phrase tuning. It can locate the current
  piano-roll Group without a prior selection call, prefers selected notes when
  no explicit scope is supplied, and combines compact pitch/timing/phoneme
  notes, Group voice/Vocal Modes, and bounded automation summaries in one
  request. Nested note and automation fingerprints become short Guard Tokens.
- Phrase diagnostics identify timing overlaps, large pitch transitions,
  sustained notes, breath-sized gaps, and dense short notes without editing the
  project. `pitchAnalysisFrames` optionally summarizes the computed contour
  without returning raw frames.
- Phrase-note seconds are rounded to 0.1 ms. Empty/default phoneme overrides,
  zero detune, and false selection flags are omitted; non-default values remain,
  and the response reports `noteDefaultsOmitted` plus `secondsPrecision`.
- Absolute ranges default to `rangeMatch: "overlap"`, which preserves a long
  note crossing the range start. Use `rangeMatch: "onset"` only when onset-only
  coverage is acceptable; it binary-seeks into the sorted Group and reports
  `coverage: "onset_only"` plus `mayExcludeEarlierSustains: true`.
- Unscoped phrase pages return an opaque `page.cursorToken` when more notes
  remain. Pass it back as `cursorToken` instead of repeating the Group locator
  and numeric offset. The server rejects an expired token, and SynthV rejects it
  with `STALE_RANGE_CURSOR` if the boundary note changed.
- `get_phrase_context.ranges` accepts up to 32 absolute ranges. The executor
  sweeps the Group once, serializes each unique matched note once, and returns
  one shared `notes` array; each range references it through `noteIndices` and
  has its own diagnostics, automation summaries, and optional pitch summary.
- Phoneme reads can filter by exact `noteIndices` and/or an overlapping absolute
  `startSeconds`/`endSeconds` range. Compact notes include timing, lyrics,
  computed phonemes, user overrides, and a short `guardToken`; large raw and
  computed attribute objects are omitted unless explicitly requested.
- Exact-index and ordinary paginated reads only fetch the returned note page.
  Time ranges convert their two boundaries once and stop scanning after the
  first later note. Set `includeComputedPhonemes: false` when only refreshing
  Guard Tokens or user overrides, avoiding the whole-Group host computation.
- Pass a note `guardToken` to `set_note_phoneme_properties` instead of its
  verbose `fingerprint`.
- Compact automation reads return `guardToken`; pass it as
  `expectedGuardToken` to `set_automation_points`.
- These Guard Tokens also work inside `apply_transaction` steps; they are
  resolved before the request reaches file IPC.
- Compact write responses contain counts and replacement Guard Tokens instead
  of complete notes or automation curves.

Guard Tokens are opaque and live only in the current MCP server process. MCP v3
automatically detects a changed SynthV/Bridge session token and clears every
cached context and Guard Token. A write then returns
`SYNTHV_SESSION_CHANGED`; read the target again and build the write from its
fresh context. A fresh read can proceed immediately and reports
`sessionReset`. Eviction or `UNKNOWN_GUARD_TOKEN` likewise requires a reread.
An MCP-requested hot reload waits for the new session token and clears these
caches before `sv_status` returns, closing the reload acknowledgement race.
The server resolves each token to the original complete fingerprint before the
request reaches SynthV, so existing stale-write protection is unchanged.

Phoneme writes are verified on a detached clone before an undo record is
created, then verified again on the project note. A host or older Voice that
quantizes or ignores a requested value fails with
`HOST_POSTCONDITION_FAILED`. Stable phoneme ranges are validated directly:
position/activity `0..1`, strength `-1..1`, and finite-second `leftOffset`
without a Bridge-imposed bound. No startup or first-use range probe is needed.

### Track colors

Track write tools accept the backward-compatible `#RRGGBB` form or a native
`AARRGGBB` value. The bridge converts `#RRGGBB` to opaque `ffRRGGBB` before
calling SynthV and verifies the value retained by the host. Track reads preserve
SynthV's raw `displayColor` and also return normalized `displayColorArgb` and
`displayColorRgb` fields when the host value is recognizable.

SynthV's editor offers a small preset palette, but the public scripting API only
defines the value as a hexadecimal string. The bridge therefore validates the
encoding without restricting callers to undocumented palette constants.

### Host capability differences

Some SynthV hosts expose `Note:getPitchAutoMode()` but fail to expose or execute
`Note:setPitchAutoMode()`. If a requested value already matches the note, the
bridge safely skips the setter. A real mode change on an incompatible host fails
with `UNSUPPORTED_HOST_CAPABILITY` before an undo record is created.

Time-axis replacement is performed as remove-then-add at occupied positions.
Every successful `set_time_axis` response has `verified: true`; a host that does
not retain the requested marks returns `HOST_POSTCONDITION_FAILED` instead of a
false success.

## Safe editing workflow

Any Agent host performing a guarded write should use this sequence:

1. For phrase tuning, call `get_phrase_context` immediately before editing.
   For Group Voice or Vocal Modes, call `get_group_voice` with no locator to
   target the current piano-roll Group. V2 returns only the parameters, Vocal
   Modes, target indices, and `contextId` by default; request full fields only
   for diagnostics. For other work, read only the object that owns the intended
   change.
2. Present or internally construct a small, reviewable change.
3. Reuse the `contextId` from that read with `contextMode: "writeIntent"`.
   The Runtime fills the group/reference UUIDs and fingerprints, track
   fingerprint, automation/time-axis fingerprint, and note or Smart Pitch
   guards from that Context, so a note edit needs only `noteIndex` and its
   `changes`. Copy guards by hand only when writing without a `contextId`; a
   copied value that disagrees with the Context fails with
   `CONTEXT_SCOPE_MISMATCH`.
4. Call the smallest write tool that completes the intended change. Group
   content writes reject a multiply referenced Note Group by default. Use
   `sharedGroupPolicy=allowAllReferences` only when changing every linked
   occurrence is intentional, and pair it with the fresh
   `expectedReferenceCount`. Prefer
   `apply_group_tuning` when one pass changes Voice/Vocal Modes,
   notes/phonemes, or multiple automation curves in the same Group. Use
   `apply_transaction` for a bounded multi-object batch; independent steps are
   preflighted before writing, while a step that uses an earlier `$result` is
   necessarily checked just before that dependent step executes.
5. If SynthV reports any `STALE_*` error, read again rather than guessing.

One compact read should feed one complete batch of related changes. Do not
refresh `contextId` by reading the whole selection or song when only Group
Voice changed.

Large edits stay batched rather than maximal. `edit_notes` and `delete_notes`
accept up to 512 items per call, but that ceiling is a protocol bound: SynthV
2.2.1 is fragile with large note batches, so keep each call at or below roughly
60 items.

One `writeIntent` `contextId` can serve several of those batches. A Context
guards each note individually, so a batch succeeds while every note it targets
still matches the fingerprint that read captured. Read one page that covers all
target notes, then send disjoint batches from that single `contextId`.

Read again when a guard can no longer be fresh:

- a note the Context already changed is rejected with `STALE_NOTE` and
  `retry: query_again`, so re-touching a note needs a new read;
- `add_notes` or `delete_notes` shifts the indices after the edited position,
  and every shifted note fails `STALE_NOTE` against the older Context.

Both cases fail before any write, so an over-optimistic reuse costs a rejected
call rather than a wrong edit.

A note fingerprint includes the group UUID, note index, onset, duration, pitch, detune, lyrics, phonemes, language, musical type, pitch mode, rap accent, retake count, and note attributes. This prevents an agent from applying an old plan to a note that the user has already changed.

## Example requests

```text
Read the notes currently selected in SynthV. Show the planned change, then extend
only the final note by half a quarter note. Use the fingerprints from the latest read.
```

```text
Read the current group's loudness automation. Add a gentle 3 dB crescendo across
the selected phrase without deleting points outside that phrase.
```

```text
Read track 1 and create a new harmony track a minor third below the selected notes.
Do not apply anything until you have listed the resulting pitches and warned about
notes outside MIDI 0–127.
```

```text
Read track 1, then clone it as "Harmony -3st" with transposeSemitones -3.
Use the latest track fingerprint. If it has non-main vocal Groups, stop unless
I explicitly approve detaching their content and reviewing their Vocals.
```

```text
Inspect D:\scores\melody.musicxml without editing SynthV. Show the selectable
part/voice/staff, overlap status, SHA-256 guard, and note preview. Import one
chosen monophonic lane only after I confirm that I have the right to use it.
```

More examples are in [examples/prompts.md](examples/prompts.md).

## Configuration

The Node server and SynthV script must resolve the **same physical IPC directory**.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_DIR` | OS temporary directory | Shared IPC directory. |
| `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Maximum response wait. The default leaves room for a cold SynthV host answering its first request. |
| `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_POLL_MS` | `10` | Node response polling interval. |
| `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_LOCK_WAIT_MS` | `1000` | How long a client waits for the single-writer lock before reporting `BRIDGE_BUSY`. Clamped to the response timeout. |
| `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_STALE_REQUEST_MS` | `60000` | Age at which abandoned request files and locks can be recovered. Must be greater than the response timeout. |
| `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_STATUS_STALE_MS` | `5000` | Maximum heartbeat age considered connected. |

When a custom IPC directory is used, create it before starting the SynthV script. The Node process also creates the directory, but the documented startup order starts SynthV first.

### Windows and WSL

The simplest setup is to run the MCP server with **Windows Node.js** when SynthV runs on Windows. When the MCP host runs inside WSL, point Node at the existing Windows temporary directory that SynthV uses by default:

- SynthV/Windows: leave `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_DIR` unset so the script uses `%TEMP%`.
- Node/WSL: set `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_DIR=/mnt/c/Users/you/AppData/Local/Temp`.

For a dedicated subdirectory, create it first and set equivalent Windows and WSL path spellings for the two processes. The SynthV GUI must inherit its Windows environment variable, so restart SynthV after changing it. The MCP server can receive its own value through the host project's MCP environment configuration.

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check
npm run inspector
```

Lua syntax can be checked with:

```bash
luac5.4 -p synthv/SynthVAgentBridge.lua synthv/StopSynthVAgentBridge.lua synthv/SynthVAgentSidebar.lua
```

CI runs TypeScript tests on Node 20 and 22, parses all three production Lua
files with Lua 5.4, and exercises both the persistent Bridge and side panel
through mock SynthV integration harnesses.

For a local installation and connection report, run:

```bash
npm run doctor -- --target "/path/to/Synthesizer V Studio 2/scripts"
```

The default Doctor checks only host-neutral Runtime state: source/installed
versions and exact script contents, compiled MCP freshness, running capability
fingerprints, Bridge/MCP heartbeats, the resolved IPC directory, and residual
processing/control files. Add `--host profiles` to discover and validate every
project profile in the repository; add `--json` for machine-readable output.
Doctor never reads or writes user-global host settings, the SynthV project, or
installed files.

## Current limitations

- One request may be in flight at a time. A second client waits up to
  `SYNTHV_AGENT_BRIDGE_LOCK_WAIT_MS` (1 s by default) for the single-writer
  lock and then reports `BRIDGE_BUSY`. Sustained parallel driving of the bridge
  from two hosts is still unsupported.
- A client-side timeout is ambiguous: SynthV may still finish the operation. The processing marker remains until the Lua host completes, and the agent should read the current project before deciding whether to retry a write.
- The current build classifies isolated Group clone, Note Group/Track/
  Track-shell clone, harmony Track, and transaction apply/rollback as
  experimental and rejects them before project IPC. Linked Group-reference
  clone remains available.
- The generic transaction schema and Fake Host implementation remain for
  diagnosis: they reject conflicting guarded scopes, support complete-field
  `$result` references, and perform full/just-in-time preflight for independent
  and dependent steps. Public transaction apply/rollback is not runnable in
  the current build.
- `atomicity: "singleUndoRecord"` means one SynthV recovery boundary, not
  automatic rollback.
  An independent preflight failure makes no project changes. A dependent
  validation or unexpected host failure can occur after earlier steps have
  written; when the error reports `undoRequired`, immediately use
  **Edit > Undo** once before rereading or retrying.
- Rollback-plan design remains project/Session-bound; current
  `rollback_transaction` is experimental-disabled together with apply.
- The optional side panel is connection-only. Requests, review, and Undo
  guidance remain in the Agent conversation and SynthV editor.
- SynthV's public scripting API does not expose project save, audio rendering,
  selecting an installed singer database by display name, reading Vocal
  identity, or Voice Panel scale/mode settings. The `clone_track_shell` schema
  describes host-cloned main-Vocal inheritance, but the current host-clone path
  is disabled after native crashes and still cannot name that Vocal.
- Local score support is intentionally import-only and bounded. It accepts
  absolute local `.xml`, `.musicxml`, `.mxl`, `.mid`, or `.midi` paths after
  explicit inspection and rights confirmation. It rejects URLs, `.svp`,
  XML `DOCTYPE`/`ENTITY`, ambiguous/polyphonic lanes, changed file hashes, and
  imports above 512 notes. Source tempo is returned for review but is not
  silently applied to the project.
- `singers` and `spacing` are returned by SynthV 2.2.1 but are not documented in the public `getVoice` field list. The typed Unison surface is therefore experimental and refuses writes unless the host returns and retains the requested fields on a cloned reference.
- The Retake API does not enumerate Take IDs or expose the active Take ID. The bridge therefore activates and deletes only the default Take or IDs it generated and stored itself.
- Expression presets are intentionally small building blocks, not phrase
  analysis or pronunciation-quality scoring.
- The bridge has not yet been validated against every SynthV 2.x patch and every voice database.
- A chat surface must be able to launch a trusted local stdio process to connect directly. Remote access would require a separate authenticated transport adapter.

## Security and privacy

This is a local control bridge. It does not upload project data. However, any connected MCP host can receive project metadata and can request edits, so connect only trusted clients and review destructive tool calls. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

The architecture was inspired by Haruki Okada's proof-of-concept [`ocadaruma/mcp-svstudio`](https://github.com/ocadaruma/mcp-svstudio), which demonstrated that a local MCP server and a persistent SynthV Lua script can communicate through files. This repository reimplements the bridge around request correlation, validation, stale-context protection, undo records, cross-platform paths, tests, and a broader tool surface.
