# v3 Architecture Baseline

Status: implemented `0.2.0-alpha.1` architecture

Decision date: 2026-07-30

This document defines the authoritative architecture implemented by Bridge
v3. The alpha contains the six-tool Facade, protocol-v3 envelope, typed
Contexts, compact Query projection, the common Command Kernel, build-coherence
gate, redacted tracing, semantic command policies, and authoritative
postcondition verification. Release evidence and remaining certification gates
are tracked in [the v3 development plan](v3-development-plan.md).

## Outcome

The implemented architecture is:

> CQRS-lite + session-scoped versioned snapshots + cache-aside +
> optimistic concurrency control + one serialized Lua command executor.

Synthesizer V remains the sole authority for live project state. Node may cache
bounded immutable projections, but a cache entry never authorizes a project
write. Lua must freshly resolve and validate every write against the current
host state.

## Goals

- Keep ordinary Agent workflows to one focused read and one logical write.
- Keep the public MCP surface at six compact v3 tools.
- Make project writes fail closed, independently verifiable, and recoverable
  with one clearly reported SynthV Undo boundary.
- Prevent shared Note Group content from being mistaken for reference-local
  data.
- Make normal responses small while preserving enough structured telemetry to
  debug failures without reproducing user content in logs.
- Migrate internal actions by tested vertical slices while making one
  intentional public/protocol breaking change from v2 to v3.

## Non-goals

- Building a second project database or a durable read replica.
- Event sourcing or reconstructing SynthV state from Bridge commands.
- Claiming MVCC, snapshot isolation, automatic rollback, or distributed
  transactions.
- Parsing, modifying, or monitoring `.svp` files as a source of live state.
- Replacing file IPC before measurements show that transport is the dominant
  remaining bottleneck.
- Mirroring the complete SynthV object graph in TypeScript.
- Moving artistic or target-selection decisions from the Agent and user into
  TypeScript or Lua.

## Existing contracts that remain authoritative

v3 does not weaken the repository safety invariants:

- File IPC protocol v3 is the only request/response envelope.
- Track, Group, and note indices remain 1-based at the protocol boundary.
- The public MCP surface is `sv_status`, `sv_describe`, `sv_query`,
  `sv_command`, `sv_ui`, and `sv_review`.
- `contextId` and Guard Tokens remain opaque, target-typed, scope-bound, and
  invalid after session change or eviction.
- Every ordinary write and independent transaction step completes preflight
  before `Project:newUndoRecord()`.
- A dependent transaction step is resolved and preflighted immediately before
  its mutation.
- Shared Group content writes default to rejection.
- SynthV is the project-state authority and the user is the listening and
  artistic authority.
- The Node process remains network-free by default.
- `.svp` files are never parsed or mutated by the Bridge.

```

Cross-cutting components attach to the Facade, projector, dispatcher, IPC
client, and Lua executor:

- session tracker;
- typed Context and Guard stores;
- trace/correlation service;
- redaction policy;
- response-size and latency metrics.

## Domain boundaries

The Bridge must model ownership instead of treating a Track clone as an
isolated object-graph clone.

### GroupContent aggregate

Identity: current SynthV session + `NoteGroup` UUID.

Includes:

- notes, lyrics, note attributes, user phonemes, and phoneme properties;
- AI Retake content associated with notes;
- Automation curves;
- Smart Pitch points and curves;
- the Note Group name and other genuinely Group-owned data.

All references to the same Note Group observe this content. Every
content-mutating command must fresh-read the reference count and enforce
`sharedGroupPolicy`.

### GroupReference aggregate

Identity: current SynthV session + Track locator + reference locator and
fingerprint.

Includes:

- target Group association;
- time and pitch offsets;
- reference time range and mute state;
- Group Voice properties, explicit Vocal Mode parameters, and other
  reference-local values exposed by the official API.

A copied `NoteGroupReference` may still target the original `NoteGroup`.
Reference cloning is therefore not proof of GroupContent isolation.

### TrackShell aggregate

Identity: current SynthV session + Track locator and fingerprint.

Includes:

- Track name, display order, color, mixer, and bounced state;
- ordered Group references;
- the host-owned main Group context.

`clone_track_shell` is the preferred way to create one verified-empty track
while inheriting the host-cloned main Vocal context.

### ProjectTimeline aggregate

Identity: current SynthV session + time-axis fingerprint.

Includes tempo and measure marks and all conversion state required to map
blicks to seconds.

### UI state

Selection, navigation, dialogs, clipboard, and playback are not project
aggregates. UI actions return the host state observed after the request and do
not create project Undo records.

## CQRS-lite boundary

CQRS-lite separates behavior and representations, not storage:

- Queries never mutate SynthV and return compact DTO projections.
- Commands represent explicit user/Agent intent and own validation,
  concurrency checks, mutation, and postcondition verification.
- Both paths ultimately read the same current SynthV project.
- There is no second durable data store and no event stream.

The v3 public MCP tools remain stable. Query and command separation is visible
as `sv_query` versus `sv_command`, while detailed actions remain internal.

## Snapshot and cache policy

### What may be cached

Node retains bounded, immutable, serialized values:

- static action descriptions and schemas;
- the existing Context/Guard bindings;
- redacted trace metadata and aggregate counters.

Lua must not retain long-lived SynthV object references between commands.

The repository also contains a tested bounded `V3SnapshotCache` component for
possible future read-only projections. Phase 6 measurements did not justify
activating it, so the production `sv_query` path does not currently cache
mutable project or computed-performance results.

### Cache entry identity

A mutable-state snapshot key must include:

- SynthV session token;
- target kind and complete locator;
- requested projection/include shape;
- the relevant Guard or aggregate version digest;
- for computed pitch or phonemes, the Group reference and all known input
  dependencies needed to prevent cross-reference reuse.

### Freshness classes

If the Snapshot LRU is activated by a later measured decision, every mutable
projection is classified as one of:

- `hostVerified`: obtained from the current host request or its verified
  postcondition read;
- `sessionCached`: reusable for a read-only response within policy limits, but
  not known to include later manual edits;
- `dirty`: invalidated by a session event, Bridge write, dependency change, or
  explicit refresh;
- `expired`: removed by age, weight, or entry-count policy.

Only `hostVerified` data may mint a write-capable Context. A
`sessionCached` result must not be used to authorize or preflight a write.

### Read behavior

- Every current project Query reaches the host, including `readOnly` Queries.
- Read paths that mint write-capable Contexts always reach the host.
- Static Action schemas and bounded diagnostics may be served from Node-owned
  process state because they are not project snapshots.
- A future cache activation must be limited to explicitly cache-tolerant
  read-only projections, report freshness in support/debug telemetry, and fall
  back to the current file IPC read on every miss, dirty entry, or error.

### Write behavior

For every write:

1. Node expands the typed Context and Guard data.
2. Lua resolves the current target from SynthV.
3. Lua recomputes and compares the applicable current fingerprint or version.
4. Lua completes full preflight.
5. Lua creates one Undo boundary and performs the mutation.
6. Lua rereads supported postconditions.
7. Node clears affected Context/Guard state and projects the verified result.

If mutable read caching is enabled in a future release, a successful write
must invalidate touched snapshot keys before optionally repopulating from the
verified host result. Such a cache still cannot become authoritative because
user edits and other scripts can bypass the Bridge.

## Concurrency model

The Bridge uses optimistic concurrency control, not MVCC:

- Contexts and Guard Tokens bind a caller to a previously observed scope.
- Lua compares that expectation with the current SynthV object state.
- A mismatch fails before the Undo boundary.
- The Bridge does not expose historical versions or concurrent snapshot
  isolation.
- Recent immutable projections may be retained for diagnostics or compact
  diffs, but they are not transaction versions.

Node and Lua keep a single logical writer:

- Node serializes file IPC operations.
- The persistent Lua executor handles one claimed request at a time.
- No per-object lock manager is added.

## Command lifecycle

Every ordinary project command follows the same observable stages:

1. `accepted`: validate the public schema and route.
2. `resolved`: expand Context/Guard data without overriding conflicting
   explicit scope.
3. `freshRead`: resolve current SynthV objects and collect required state.
4. `guarded`: compare concurrency expectations and shared-content policy.
5. `preflighted`: validate all prepared values and host capabilities.
6. `undoOpened`: create the one SynthV recovery boundary.
7. `mutated`: call official API mutations.
8. `verified`: reread supported postconditions.
9. `projected`: return a minimal acknowledgement and replacement Context.

An operation cannot report success only because no exception was thrown.
Every successful write must report an expected affected count or another
action-specific postcondition. An unexpected zero-effect mutation is
`HOST_POSTCONDITION_FAILED` or a more specific existing error.

Transactions retain the existing independent/dependent preflight rules.
`singleUndoRecord` continues to describe a recovery boundary rather than an
automatic rollback guarantee.

## Clone semantics

The public intent must be explicit:

- `linked`: new references intentionally target existing GroupContent.
- `isolated`: each non-main GroupContent target is separately cloned and
  verified.
- `shell`: one verified-empty host-cloned Track shell.

`isolated` success requires all of the following:

- every cloned content target has a different Group UUID from its source;
- each expected new Group has the intended fresh reference count;
- the source note, Automation, and Smart Pitch summary is captured before
  Undo and confirmed unchanged through a separate fresh host read;
- a postcondition proves that references point to the intended targets;
- non-main Vocal identity limitations are reported and require manual review.

Do not reread GroupContent through a proxy in the same Lua callback after
inserting a cloned Note Group into the library. SynthV 2.2.1 can terminate the
host on an immediate post-mutation Automation access. Same-callback
postconditions are therefore structural and reference-local; source-content
preservation is verified by the next authoritative read.

No boolean named only `deepCopy` is sufficient to represent these semantics.

## Response projections

Normal Agent responses prioritize intent and outcome:

- `traceId`;
- success/error code;
- affected counts and durable identifiers;
- warnings and manual Vocal review requirements;
- one-Undo guidance when applicable;
- replacement `contextId` when safe.

Normal responses omit:

- raw fingerprints;
- full before/after objects;
- lyrics and note lists not explicitly requested;
- stack traces;
- cache keys and internal filenames.

Support/debug representations are defined in
[ADR-0006](adr/0006-observability-and-redaction.md).

## Error and recovery policy

Errors are classified by phase and recovery:

- input/scope errors: correct the request; no project write occurred;
- stale/session errors: reread the target; do not reuse old Contexts;
- shared-content policy errors: choose linked/all-reference intent explicitly;
- host capability errors: choose a supported operation or require manual work;
- postcondition errors before mutation: no Undo required;
- execution or dependent-step errors after mutation began: report
  `undoRequired` and require one SynthV Undo before reread or retry.

Large raw Guard values are never included in a normal error. Support telemetry
uses hashes, counts, target kinds, and phase information.

High-risk clone and transaction paths additionally maintain one bounded local
crash breadcrumb while the host call is in flight. It contains only the
`traceId`, action, last stage, build identity, Session token, and timestamp; it
contains no lyrics, notes, curves, raw fingerprints, or request payloads.
Successful completion and handled failures remove the breadcrumb. Its purpose
is to identify the last native-host boundary after a process crash, not to
provide recovery, retry, or proof that no mutation occurred.

## Implemented internal seams

The v3 runtime uses these seams:

- Query projector: builds bounded DTOs and projection identities.
- Command dispatcher: owns the common lifecycle and action routing.
- Domain target resolver: distinguishes GroupContent, GroupReference,
  TrackShell, ProjectTimeline, and UI state.
- Trace collector: correlates MCP, Context expansion, file IPC, Lua stages, and
  result projection.
- Host adapter/fake host: gives Lua command behavior a deterministic test seam.
- Internal adapters use `v3_internal_*` names and cannot be registered as
  public or legacy MCP tools.
- The dormant Snapshot cache remains an optional component rather than an
  active runtime seam.
